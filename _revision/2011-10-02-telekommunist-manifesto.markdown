Foreword

I coined the term ‘Venture Communism’ in 2001 to promote the ideal of workers’
self-organization of production as a way of addressing class conflict.
Telekommunisten is a collective based in Berlin, Germany, where I have lived
since 2003. I first encountered the term ‘Telekommunisten’ (which became the
name of the collective) in 2005, while visiting the apartment of a friend. He
and his roommate had given the name ‘Telekommunisten’ to the local area network
used in their apartment to share internet access.

Telekommunisten had been used as a derogatory term for Germany’s former state
telephone company, Deutsch Telekomm, which is now a private transnational
corporation whose ‘T-Mobile’ brand is known worldwide. The usage of communist
here is intended to cast the telephone company as a monolithic, authoritarian,
and bureaucratic behemoth. This is a completely different understanding to the
positive use of the term as an engagement in class conflict towards the goal of
a free society without economic classes, where people produce and share as
equals, a society with no property and no state, that produces not for profit,
but for social value. In this way, we are not simply a collective of
worker-agitators toiling in the sphere of telecommunications. Telekommunisten
promotes the notion of a distributed communism: a communism at a distance,
a Tele-communism. A venture commune is not bound to one physical location where
it can be isolated and confined. Similar in topology to a peer-to-peer network,
Telekommunisten intends to be decentralized, with only minimal coordination
required amongst its international community of producer-owners.

My background is in the hacker and art communities, where I have been active
since the early 90s. My views have been developed and expressed in online and
offline correspondence in the course of my involvement in software development,
activism and cultural production. Although I have written a few essays over the
years, those who know my work generally know me personally through encounters
in electronic and physical social spaces. The present work is a ‘Manifesto’,
not in the sense that it outlines a complete theoretical system, a dogmatic set
of beliefs or the platform of a political movement, but in the spirit of the
meaning of manifesto as a beginning or introduction. Matteo Pasquinelli, who
pushed me to undertake this ‘Manifesto’, felt that my role as a background
voice in our community was too underground and declared it was ‘time to come
out’ with a published text. He connected me with Geert Lovink, who suggested
the structure and approach of the text and offered to serve as editor and,
through the Institute of Network Cultures, as its publisher.

The Telekommunist Manifesto is largely a cut-up, a reworking of texts I’ve
produced and co-produced over the last few years. It incorporates significant
passages from ‘Copyright, Copyleft and the Creative Anti-Commons’ produced in
co-operation with Joanne Richardson and originally published under ‘Anna
Nimmus’ on the subsol website. Much of the text regarding the commercialization
of the internet is taken from ‘Infoenclosure 2.0’, co-written with Brian Wyrick
and originally published in Mute Magazine. Credit is also due to Mute Magazine
editors Josephine Berry Slater and Anthony Iles, for their work on ‘Infoenclure
2.0’ and ‘Copyjustright, Copyfarfleft’, much of which is reused here.

Introduction

In the preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx
argues that, ‘at a certain stage of development, the material productive forces
of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production’.i What
is possible in the information age is in direct conflict with what is
permissible. Publishers, film producers and the telecommunication industry
conspire with lawmakers to bottle up and sabotage free networks, to forbid
information from circulating outside of their control. The corporations in the
recording industry attempt to forcibly maintain their position as mediators
between artists and fans, as fans and artists merge closer together and explore
new ways of interacting.

Competing software makers, like arms manufacturers, play both sides in this
conflict: providing the tools to impose control, and the tools to evade it. The
non-hierarchical relations made possible by a peer network, such as the
internet, are contradictory with capitalism’s need for enclosure and control.
It’s a battle to the death; either the internet as we know it must go, or
capitalism as we know it must go. Will capital throw us back into the network
dark ages of CompuServe, mobile telephones and cable tv rather than allow peer
communications to bring about a new society? Yes, if they can. Marx concludes,
‘no social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for which there
is room in it have developed; and new, higher relations of production never
appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the
womb of the old society itself’.ii

The Telekommunist Manifesto is an exploration of class conflict and property,
born from a realization of the primacy of economic capacity in social
struggles. Emphasis is placed on the distribution of productive assets and
their output. The interpretation here is always tethered to an understanding
that wealth and power are intrinsically linked, and only through the former can
the latter be achieved. As a collective of intellectual workers, the work of
Telekommunisten is very much rooted in the free software and free culture
communities. However, a central premise of this Manifesto is that engaging in
software development and the production of immaterial cultural works is not
enough. The communization of immaterial property alone cannot change the
distribution of material productive assets, and therefore cannot eliminate
exploitation; only the self-organization of production by workers can.

This publication is intended as a summary of the positions that motivate the
Telekommunisten project, based on an exploration of class conflict in the age
of international telecommunications, global migration, and the emergence of the
information economy. The goal of this text is to introduce the political
motivations of Telekommunisten, including a sketch of the basic theoretical
framework in which it is rooted. Through two interrelated sections,
‘Peer-to-Peer Communism vs. The Client-Server Capitalist State’ and ‘A
Contribution to the Critique of Free Culture’, the Manifesto covers the
political economy of network topologies and cultural production respectively.
‘Peer-to-Peer Communism vs. The Client-Server Capitalist State’ focuses on the
commercialization of the internet and the emergence of networked distributed
production. It proposes a new form of organization as a vehicle for class
struggle: venture communism. The section ends with the famous program laid out
by Marx and Engels in their Communist Manifesto, adapted into a Manifesto for
a networked society.

Building on the previous section, in ‘A Contribution to the Critique of Free
Culture’, the Manifesto continues with the history and misperceptions of
copyright, the free software movement, anticopyright/ copyleft dissent, and the
political economy of free software and free culture. The challenge of extending
the achievements of free software into free culture is addressed by connecting
it to the traditional program of the socialist left, resulting in copyfarleft
and offering the Peer Production License as a model.

This text is particularly addressed to politically motivated artists, hackers
and activists, not to evangelize a fixed position, but to contribute to an
ongoing critical dialogue.

Peer-to-Peer Communism vs. The Client-Server Capitalist State

Society is composed of social relations. These form the structures that
constitute it. Computer networks, like economic systems, then may be described
in terms of social relations. Advocates of communism have long described
communities of equals; peer-to-peer networks implement such relations in their
architecture. Conversely, capitalism depends on privilege and control, features
that, in computer networks, can only be engineered into centralized,
client-server applications. Economic systems shape the networks they create,
and as networks become more integral to every day life, are in turn shaped by
them. It is then essential to produce a critical understanding of political
economy in order to comprehend emerging trends in network topology and their
social implications.

The history of the internet illustrates how this process has unfolded. The
internet started as a network that embodied the relations of peer-to-peer
communism; however, it has been re-shaped by capitalist finance into an
inefficient and un-free client-server topology. The existence of peer-to-peer
networks that allow producers to collaborate on a global scale has ushered in
new forms of production. Such peer production has thus far been largely
contained to non-tangible, immaterial creation, yet has the potential to be
extended to material production and become a threat to the existence of
capitalism. In order for this to take place, an alternative to venture
capitalism needs to provide a means of acquiring and efficiently allocating the
collectively owned material wealth required to build free networks and free
societies.

We need venture communism, a form of struggle against the continued expansion
of property-based capitalism, a model for worker self-organization inspired by
the topology of peer-to-peer networks and the historical pastoral commons.

The Conditions of the Working Class on the Internet

The only way to change society is to produce and share differently.

Capitalism has its means of self-reproduction: venture capitalism. Through
their access to the wealth that results from the continuous capture of surplus
value, capitalists offer each new generation of innovators a chance to become
a junior partner in their club by selling the future productive value of what
they create in exchange for the present wealth they need to get started. The
stolen, dead value of the past captures the unborn value of the future. Neither
the innovators, nor any of the future workers in the organizations and
industries they create, are able to retain the value of the contribution.

This ‘unretained’ value forms the wealth that goes on to capture the next wave
of innovation. This captured wealth is applied by its private owners towards
political control, to impose the interests of property owners on society at the
expense of the interests of workers. For innovation to be born and allowed to
develop in, and for, the common wealth, we need venture communism. We must
develop ways to create and to reproduce commons-based productive relationships.

Whether the products of labor are captured by commons-based producers or by
capitalist appropriators will determine the kind of society we will have, one
based on co-operation and sharing, or one based on force and exploitation. The
venture communist struggle against class stratification could not be more
vital. Not only does our society face the age-old afflictions of poverty and
injustice, but it is becoming clear that the production levels required to
sustain the accumulation of an elite few drive us repeatedly into war, and
inevitably towards environmental catastrophe. Failure to achieve a more
equitable society has consequences far graver than we can afford to bear. To
succeed, the space, instruments and resources needed must be made available as
a common stock, and employed in production by a dispersed community of peers,
producing and sharing as equals.

Politics is not a battle of ideas; it is a battle of capacities. Ideas are
powerful, and their development and implementation can certainly have
a political impact; however, the development and implementation of ideas is
determined not by their intrinsic value, but by the relative power of those who
benefit from the idea versus those who are threatened. The capacity to change
a social order requires the wherewithal to overcome competing capacities for,
amongst other things, communication and lobbying. These capacities are, at
their base, economic capacities. Change then requires the application of enough
wealth to overcome the wealth of those who resist such a change. Such wealth
arises only from production.

New ways of producing and sharing, then, are a precondition of any change in
the social order. These new methods of production and sharing require the
creation of new kinds of relationships, new productive relations, to constitute
a new economic structure that is able to give rise to a new kind of society. No
social order, no matter how entrenched and ruthlessly imposed, can resist
transformation when new ways of producing and sharing emerge.

To reiterate, society is composed of social relationships, relationships that
include relations of production. These relations of production constitute the
economic structure of society, which give rise to the legal and political
structures that further define it. Relations between buyer and seller, tenant
and landlord, employee and employer, those born to wealth and privilege and
those born to precarity and struggle, are all outcomes of these relations of
production. These relations determine how things are produced and shared in
society. Those who are able to control the circulation of the product of the
labor of others can impose laws and social institutions according to their
interests. Those who are not able to retain control of the product of their own
labor are not able to resist.

Capitalism depends on the appropriation of value for its subsistence and
growth. The disingenuous rhetoric of the ‘free market economy’ is a smoke
screen to justify a system of privilege and exploitation, perhaps better called
the ‘casino economy’. There are certainly some conspicuous winners, but the
odds always favor the house. Any organized attempt to beat the odds will be
excluded, perhaps violently. In a genuinely free economy, competition among
producers would reduce the price of everything to the lowest level. If
commodities were traded in a truly perfect ‘market’, then land and capital,
like labor, would never be able to earn any more than the cost of the
production of provision. There could be no class that is exempt from working,
as there would be no income to sustain such a class.

For a capitalist class to exist, the market must be rigged, and indeed, all
markets are. Capitalism must increase the price of capital by withholding it
from labor. In reality, the ‘free market’ is an imposition by property owners
on to workers, while retaining their own privileges. Capital needs to make the
price of labor low enough to prevent workers, as a class, from being able to
retain enough of their own earnings to acquire their own property. If workers
could acquire their own property, they could also stop selling their labor to
the capitalists. Capitalism, then, could not exist in a free market. The whole
idea of the ‘free market’ is part of the mythology of capitalism. It is not
possible within capitalism and just as unlikely to exist without it.

If ‘freed’ from the coercion of profit-seeking capitalists, producers would
produce for social value, not for profits, as they do in their private and
family lives, and as they do in non-capitalist communities. This is not to say
that a free society would not have competition, or that its members would not
seek to benefit from their own labor. Indeed, the division of labor required in
a complex society makes exchange and reciprocity necessary. However, the
metaphor of ‘the market’ as it is currently used would no longer hold.

The ‘market economy’ is, by definition, a surveillance economy, where
contributions to production and consumption must be measured in minute detail.
It is an economy of accountants and security guards. The accounting of value
exchange in tiny and reductive lists of individually priced transactions must
be superseded by more fluid and generalized forms of exchange. The motive to
maximize profit from ownership, so often the driving force behind irrational
and destructive forms of production, would give way to a much stronger motive
for production: doing work that has direct benefits for our lives and our
    society, production that fulfills real world needs and desires.

Capitalist apologists will insist that these motives are one and the same, that
profit is simply the financial reward for producing what the community needs,
but this relationship is tenuous at best. While the increased price of goods in
short supply does direct productive activities towards particular areas, the
extraction of profit from this production by property owners does little to
address social needs. When profit is the motive, price can be increased or
costs reduced through predatory, exploitative and anti-competitive business
practices, that do not contribute to the fulfillment of community needs. When
workers are able to form their own capital, and thereby retain the entire
product of their labor, the motivations to pursue such practices fade.

Without the need to account for and measure our consumption and production to
appease the imposers of capitalist control, workers in a free society may not
bother producing exclusively to maximize profit within a ‘market economy’.
Instead, they may decide to focus their efforts on producing what they want and
what their community needs, and are motivated to share the products of their
labor out of mutual respect. This type of economy does not resemble a ‘market’.

The ‘market’ has become such a pervasive metaphor for ‘free exchange’ that the
whole of society is frequently, and uncritically described in terms of
a physical marketplace. A physical marketplace is not a free space. Control of
the physical location of the market has always been the domain of hierarchy and
authority, and proximity to the physical market is the textbook example of
unearned income, referred to by economists as ‘economic rent’. The market stall
is a physical manifestation of the division between producer and consumer. None
of these appear to be essential characteristics of a free society. Instead of
an idealized and impossible ‘free market’, a workers’ economy would be better
conceptualized as a ‘network economy’, where independent participants exchange
according their mutual desires within the context of a common platform, not
centrally controlled by any of them, but composed of their own voluntary
interconnections.

Capitalism depends on the state to impose control within the network economy,
particularly to control relations through authorized channels, and thereby
capture value that would otherwise be retained by its producers. Points of
control are introduced into the natural mesh of social relations. The ‘market
economy’ is then the imposition of the ‘unfree’ terms of a physical marketplace
onto society broadly. The distinction between producer and consumer must be
enforced so that circulation can be controlled. Hierarchy and authority must
have privileged access.

The absurd and reductionist idea that we are to conceive of society itself as
a marketplace is born from the imagination of capitalism, a paradise for the
extortionist and the bookmaker. The means of imposing the relations of the
marketplace on all of society is provided by the state. The state’s traditional
role of mediating between the classes on behalf of the ruling class depends on
its territorial sovereignty. The state's ability to impose control on the
network economy depends on the fact that the participants mostly interact
within the state’s boundaries. Once the network expands beyond the state it has
the potential to become a threat to the state itself, by undermining the
territorially-based capture of value.

The state’s ability to grant title and privilege is based on its ability to
enforce such advantages through its monopoly on the legitimate use of violence.
Communications based on global peer networks have a chance to resist and evade
the violence contained within such hierarchies. Social relations among
transnational, trans-local communities operate within an extra-territorial
space, one where the operations of title and privilege could give way to
relations of mutual interest and negotiation.

Modes of production employing structures similar to peer-to-peer networks have
relations reminiscent of the historic pastoral commons, long gone commonly held
lands used for the maintenance of livestock and regulated by ancient rights
predating modern laws and governments. The modern commons, however, is not
located in a single space, but rather spans the planet, offering our society
hope for a way out from the class stratification of capitalism by undermining
its logic of control and extraction. Examples of such a potential mode of
production can be readily found.

Peer networks, such as the internet, and all the material and immaterial inputs
that keep them running, serve as a common stock that is used independently by
many people. Free software, whose production and distribution frequently
depends on peer networks, is a common stock available to all. Free software is
produced by diverse and distributed producers who contribute to it because they
gain greater value in using the software in their own production, than the
value of their individual contributions to the software. Popular attacks on the
royalties and fees (rents) captured by the recording and movie industries by
users of file sharing technologies show us the difficulties faced by those
whose incomes depend on controlling reproduction. Mass transportation and
international migration have created distributed communities who maintain
ongoing interpersonal and often informal economic relationships across national
borders.

All of these are examples of new productive relationships that transcend
current property-based relations and point to a potential way forward.
Developments in telecommunications, notably the emergence of peer networks such
as the internet, along with international transportation and migration, create
broad revolutionary possibilities as dispersed communities become able to
interact instantly on a global scale. Our lives and relationships no longer
need to be confined to territorially bounded nation states. Though coercive
elements in the political and corporate hierarchy impose ever more draconian
controls in an attempt to prevent our resistance to, and evasion of, such
confinement, we can place our revolutionary hopes in the possibility that the
scale of change is simply so large that they can never fully succeed.

As bold as the emergence of peer-to-peer technologies, free software and
international communities have been, the obstacles to social change are
daunting. We must overcome the great accumulation of wealth the capitalist
elite have at their disposal. This wealth gives them the ability to shape
society according to their interests. In order to change society we must
actively expand the scope of our commons, so that our independent communities
of peers can be materially sustained and can resist the encroachments of
capitalism.

Whatever portion of our productivity we allow to be taken from us will return
in the form of our own oppression.

Chief among the state’s interventions into the network economy is its
enforcement of property. Property is by its nature antagonistic to freedom.
Property is the ability to control productive assets at a distance, the ability
to ‘own’ something that is put to productive use by another person. Property
makes possible the subjugation of individuals and communities. Where property
is sovereign, there can be no freedom within its domain. The owners of scarce
property can deny life by denying access to property, then make the living work
like slaves for no pay beyond their reproduction costs.

In economic terminology, the income that owners receive, by appropriating the
products of workers, is called rent. British classical political economist
David Ricardo first described economic rent in the early 19th century. Put
simply, economic rent is the income the owner of a productive asset can earn
just from ownership itself. The owner earns rental income not by doing anything
or making any sort of contribution, but just by owning.iii In the terms of John
Stuart Mill, the rent collector earns money even as he sleeps.iv

Take for example two identical buildings, one in a major economic center, and
one in a minor city. Both are built of identical materials, both require an
identical amount of work to maintain, and there is no difference in terms of
the costs that must be undertaken by the owners to bring these buildings to
market as dwellings or commercial spaces. The building in the major city will,
however, earn more income than the one in the minor city, not withstanding the
equal amounts of work and expense undertaken to maintain them. This difference
is economic rent, and not rent in terms of the price you pay for housing. Rent
is not collected for any contribution to production, but because of legal
privilege, such as a title to a valuable location.

This does not mean that the owner does not contribute to the value of the
property, such as through maintenance, only that the value of whatever
contribution they make is not calculated as rent, but for example, as interest
if it directly increases the value of the property. Rent, in economic terms, is
    the income earned for allowing others to use property; ultimately, this
    income is derived from the landlord claiming a portion of what the tenants
    produce as their own. This is not strictly about landlords, rent and
    property in a housing or building sense. As our ability to provide for our
    material subsistence requires access to the property that makes up our
    ‘means of production’, we must agree to transfer a portion of what we
    produce to those who allow us to access such means, or else we could not
    live.

The portion of a producer’s productive output that can be demanded for the
right to exist is the entire total of their productive output, minus the
producer’s subsistence costs. This is the conclusion reached by David Ricardo
in his 1817 On Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,v and this is the
basic bargaining position faced by all of us who are born into a world entirely
owned by others.

In his ‘Essay on Profits’, Ricardo argues: ‘The interest of the landlord is
always opposed to the interest of every other class in the community’.vi This
analysis was not based on the social milieu, such as a general distinction
between upper and lower classes, but rather on a relationship with the factors
of production, land, labor or capital. This Ricardian model provides a logical
basis for the idea that the classes, landlord, worker and capitalist, have
diametrically opposed interests.

Upper class and lower class may imply an unfair society, but this distinction
does not necessarily imply conflicting interests, and thus does not offer an
understanding of the source of class stratification. As representative of the
emergent capitalist class, Ricardo did not intend his critique of land rent to
be extended to the income earned by capitalists. Critical commentators like
William Thompson and Thomas Hodgskin, the best known of the ‘Ricardian
Socialists’ did just that, arguing that profits earned by capitalists are just
as exploitive and unearned as the rents of landlords, and that the interests of
workers are opposed to the interests of both landlords and capitalists. From
their work, the critique of ‘capitalism’, a term coined to draw an analogy with
Feudalism, begins.

Socialism, and all other movements of the ‘left’, start with this class
conflict as their point of departure. The belief that producers themselves
should own the means of production was already common among socialists of the
time, notably among the supporters of social reformer Robert Owen and the
co-operative movement during the early 1800s. This understanding of class,
based on a relation with the means of production, such as capitalist, landlord
and worker, rather than categories such as rich and poor, noble, clergy or
peasant, provided a solid intellectual foundation that allowed a more
scientific socialism to emerge from its utopian roots.

Rent allows owners of scarce property to drive property-less workers to
subsistence. As Ricardo explains, ‘the natural price of labor is that price
which is necessary to enable the laborers, one with another, to subsist and to
perpetuate their race’.vii It is often claimed that this can be refuted because
of the difference between the theoretical ‘natural’ price and the actual market
price of labor, but such an argument is simply an equivocation, explains
Ricardo, because market price fluctuates. Subsistence should not be taken to
mean the bare minimum required to actually survive and reproduce. Even in
Ricardo’s time, most workers were generally not in the position that if they
earned one penny less they would immediately fall over and die. Rather workers,
by their very definition, are unable to earn enough to do anything more than
make a living and struggle to live according to the acceptable standards of
their community. These ‘acceptable standards’ are established in terms of the
canons of taste and decency established by a predatory economic elite.

Thorstein Veblen, a Norwegian-American economist and sociologist whose work
lays the foundation for the institutional economics movement, argues that, in
a class society, all but the very richest are compelled to dispose of
practically their entire income in order to live according to community
standards of respectability, in what he calls ‘conspicuous consumption’ and
‘conspicuous waste’. To not participate in conspicuous consumption is to face
social exclusion and further reduced prospects of upward mobility.viii ‘Failure
to consume in due quantity and quality becomes a mark of inferiority and
demerit’, Veblen argues in his 1899 The Theory of the Leisure Class.ix

Workers have more than cultural forces working against their ability to form
capital from whatever earnings they retain beyond subsistence. So long as
workers do not have property, whatever wage increases they gain are swept away
by price inflation, most often as the result of increased money competition for
locations and the increase of land rents. This is no secret to capitalist
negotiators and their public sector collaborators. Reducing real wages by
inflation as an alternative to reducing money wages works because of the ‘money
illusion’. As John Maynard Keynes, perhaps the most important economist of his
day and the founder of modern ‘macroeconomics’ writes in his 1936 book The
General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, ‘it is sometimes said it
would illogical for labor to resist a reduction of money-wages but not to
resist a reduction of real wages […] experience shows that this is how labor in
fact behaves’.x Daniel Bell makes this process clear in his paper ‘The
Subversion of Collective Bargaining’, where he examines several cases of wage
increases won by collective bargaining. Bell shows that these cases do not lead
to a change in the general level of real wealth; rather in most cases, workers
who received a wage increase had not increased their share of wealth, but wound
up paying higher prices.xi

Property is not a natural phenomenon; property is created by law. The ability
to extract rent is dependent on one’s ability to control a scarce resource even
though it is in use by someone else. In other words, property entitles the
property owner to force the other person to share the product of their labor.
Property, then, is control at a distance. In this way, rent is only possible so
long as it is supported by force, which is happily provided by the state to the
owners of property.

Without a means to force those who put property to productive use to share the
product of their labor with the absent and idle property owner, the property
owner could not earn a living, let alone accumulate more property. As German
revolutionary Marxist Ernest Mandel claims in ‘Historical Materialism and the
Capitalist State’, ‘without capitalist state violence, there is no secure
capitalism’.xii The purpose of property is to ensure that a property-less class
exists to produce the wealth enjoyed by a propertied class. The institution of
property does not benefit workers. This is not to say that individual workers
cannot become property owners, but rather that to do so means to escape their
class. Individual success stories do not change the class system. As Canadian
political philosopher Gerald Cohen, proponent of Analytical Marxism, quipped,
‘I want to rise with my class, not above my class!’xiii

The current global situation confirms that workers, as a class, are not able to
accumulate property. A study by the World Institute for Development Economics
Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults
alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000, and that the richest 10% of
adults accounted for 85% of the world total. The bottom half of the world adult
population owned barely 1% of global wealth. Extensive statistics, many
indicating growing world disparity, are included in the report.xiv

The condition of the working class in society is largely one of powerlessness
and poverty; the condition of the working class on the internet is no
different. The requirements of control and privilege required by capitalism are
being imposed on the internet, changing the topology of the network from one
where peer-to-peer communism is embedded in its architecture, to one where
client server applications have become central, and increasingly mediate and
control all relationships.

Trapped in the World Wide Web

The revolutionary possibilities of the early internet lay particularly in the
capacity for direct interaction between users. As such, the internet promised
to be a platform where freedom of speech and association was built into the
architecture. However, without most users noticing, the architecture of the
internet is changing, and the topology of the network is being remade in such
a way that not only serves the interests of capitalism, but also enables
monitoring and control of its users on a scale never dreamed of before.

The internet took the corporate world by surprise, emerging as it did from
publicly funded universities, military research, and civil society. It was
promoted by a cottage industry of small independent internet service providers,
who were able to squeeze a buck from providing access to the state-built and
financed network. Meanwhile, the corporate world was pushing a different idea
of the information superhighway, producing monolithic, centralized ‘online
services’ like CompuServe, Prodigy and AOL. What made these corporate services
different from the internet is that they were centralized systems that users
connect to directly, while the internet is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network where
every device with a public internet address can communicate directly to any
other device.

While both users of CompuServe and the internet had access to similar
applications, such as email, discussion groups, chat groups and file sharing,
users of CompuServe were completely dependent on CompuServe for access, while
users of the internet could gain access through any service provider, and could
even chose to run their own servers. Platforms such as internet email, and
internet relay chat were based on a distributed structure that no one owned or
controlled. This structure was accepted by the most enthusiastic early adopters
of the internet, such as public institutions and non-government organizations.
However, capitalist investors were unable to see how such an unrestricted
system would allow them to earn profits. The internet seemed anathema to the
capitalist imagination.

The original dotcom boom, then, was characterized by a rush to own
infrastructure, to consolidate independent internet service providers and take
control of the network. Money was near-randomly thrown around as investors
struggled to understand what this medium would be used for. Ultimately, the
mission of these investors was largely successful. Their mission was to destroy
the independent service provider and put large, well-financed corporations back
in the driver’s seat. If you had an internet account in 1996 it was likely
provided by a small local company. Ten years later, while some of the smaller
companies had survived, most people were getting their internet access from
gigantic telecommunications corporations, which persists even stronger today.

The internet is more than the Web, a term inaccurately used as a synonym for
the entire network and all of the applications that run on it. The World Wide
Web is a technology that runs on top of the peer-to-peer network that is the
internet; however, it is unlike the classic internet technologies like email,
IRC, Usenet etc. The Web is neither distributed, nor is it peer-to-peer; it is
a client-server technology. The publisher of a website runs the servers and has
exclusive control over the content and applications their website provides,
including control of who should or should not have access to it. The users have
control of the browser, the client software used to access the website.
A website has more in common with CompuServe than a peer-to-peer system. The
publisher has full control of the content and options available to users.

The Web started innocently enough as a platform for publishing text online;
however, it rapidly became the focal point for organizations looking to
commercialize the internet. From modest beginnings, as companies began to put
brochures online, the commercial Web took off with the development of
e-Commerce. At this point, the Web had not yet taken over online sharing.
People used the Web to, for instance, browse a bookstore, but continued to
employ distributed technologies to communicate with other users. However, soon
enough the Web, funded by venture capital, would move in to make websites
operated by large corporations the primary online social platforms. The
internet itself would soon disappear behind the Web, and users would never
again leave their browser.

Web 2.0 emerged as a venture capitalist’s paradise, where investors pocket the
value produced by unpaid users, ride on the technical innovations of the free
software movement, and kill off the decentralizing potential of peer-to-peer
technology.

Wikipedia says that:

Web 2.0, a phrase coined by O’Reilly Media in 2004, refers to a supposed second
generation of internet-based services, such as social networking sites, wikis,
communication tools, and folksonomies, that emphasize online collaboration and
sharing among users.xv

The use of the word ‘supposed’ is noteworthy. As the largest collaboratively
authored work in history, Wikipedia should know. Unlike most of the members of
the Web 2.0 generation, Wikipedia is controlled by a non-profit foundation,
earns income only by donation, and releases its content under a copyleft
license. It is telling that this Wikipedia entry goes on to say ‘[Web 2.0] has
become a popular (though ill-defined and often criticized) buzzword among
certain technical and marketing communities’.

The free software community has tended to be suspicious, if not outright
dismissive, of the Web 2.0 moniker. Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of World Wide
Web, dismissed the term saying that, ‘Web 2.0 is of course a piece of jargon,
nobody even knows what it means’. He goes on to note that ‘it means using the
standards which have been produced by all these people working on Web 1.0’.xvi
In reality, then, there is neither a Web 1.0 nor a Web 2.0. There is only an
ongoing development of online applications that cannot be cleanly divided.

In trying to define what Web 2.0 is, it is safe to say that most of the
important developments have been aimed at enabling the community to create,
modify, and share content in a way that was previously only available to
centralized organizations that bought expensive software packages, paid staff
to handle the technical aspects of the site, and paid staff to create content
which generally was published only on that organization’s site.

A Web 2.0 company, then, fundamentally changes the production of internet
content. Web applications and services have become cheaper and easier to
implement, and by allowing end users access to these applications, a company
can effectively outsource the creation and the organization of their content to
the end users themselves. Instead of the traditional model of a content
provider publishing their own content and the end user consuming it, the new
model allows the company’s site to act as the centralized portal for users who
are both creators and consumers. For the user, access to these applications
empowers them to create and publish content that previously would have required
them to purchase desktop software and possess a greater technological skill
set. For example, two of the primary means of text-based content production in
Web 2.0 are blogs and wikis. These allow the user to create and publish content
directly from their browser without any real knowledge of markup language, file
transfer or syndication protocols, and all without the need to purchase any
software.

The use of web applications to replace desktop software is even more
significant for the user when it comes to content that is not merely textual.
Not only can web pages be created and edited in the browser without purchasing
HTML editing software, photographs can be uploaded and manipulated online
through the browser without expensive desktop image manipulation applications.
A video shot on a consumer camcorder can be submitted to a video hosting site,
uploaded, encoded, embedded into an HTML page, published, tagged, and
syndicated across the web all through the user’s browser. In Paul Graham’s
article on Web 2.0, he breaks down the different roles of the community/user
more specifically. These include the professional, the amateur, and the user
(more precisely, the end user). The roles of the professional and the user
were, according to Graham, well understood in Web 1.0, but the amateur didn’t
have a very well defined place.xvii As Graham describes it in ‘What Business
Can Learn From Open Source’, the amateur just loves to work, with no concern
for compensation or ownership of that work. In development, the amateur
    contributes to open source software whereas the professional gets paid for
    their proprietary work.xviii

Graham’s characterization of the ‘amateur’ has an odd similarity to If I Ran
The Circus by children's author Dr. Seuss, where young Morris McGurk says of
the staff of his imaginary Circus McGurkus:

My workers love work.

They say, “Work us! Please work us!

We'll work and we'll work up so many surprises

You'd never see half if you had forty eyeses!”xix

And while the term ‘Web 2.0’ may mean nothing to Tim Berners-Lee, who views
recent innovations as no more than the continued development of the Web, for
venture capitalists, who like Morris McGurk dream of tireless workers producing
endless content without demanding a paycheck, it sounds stupendous. And indeed,
from YouTube to Flickr to Wikipedia, you’d truly ‘never see half if you had
forty eyeses’. Tim Berners-Lee is correct. There is nothing, from a technical
or user point of view, in Web 2.0 that does not have its roots in, and is not
a natural development from, the earlier generation of the Web. The technology
associated with the Web 2.0 banner was possible and in some cases readily
available before, but the hype surrounding this usage has certainly affected
the growth of Web 2.0 internet sites.

The internet has always been about sharing between users. Indeed Usenet, the
distributed messaging system, has been operating since 1979. Since then, Usenet
has been hosting discussions, ‘amateur’ journalism, and photo and file sharing.
Like the internet, it is a distributed system not owned or controlled by
anyone. It is this quality, a lack of central ownership and control, which
differentiates services such as Usenet from Web 2.0.

If Web 2.0 means anything at all, its meaning lies in the rationale of venture
capital. Web 2.0 represents the return of investment in internet start-ups.
After the dotcom bust (the real end of Web 1.0), those seeking investment
dollars needed a new rationale for investing in online ventures. ‘Build it and
they will come’, the dominant attitude of the 90s dotcom boom, along with the
delusional ‘new economy’, was no longer attractive after so many online
ventures failed. Building infrastructure and financing real capitalization was
no longer what investors were looking for. Capturing value created by others,
however, proved to be a more attractive proposition.

Web 2.0 is Internet Investment Boom 2.0. Web 2.0 is a business model of private
capture of community-created value. No one denies that the technology of sites
like YouTube, for instance, is trivial. This is more than evidenced by the
large number of identical services such as Daily Motion for online video
sharing. The real value of YouTube is not created by the developers of the
site; rather, it is created by the people who upload videos to the site. Yet,
when YouTube was bought for over a billion dollars worth of Google stock, how
much of this stock was acquired by those that made all these videos? Zero.
Zilch. Nada. A great deal, then, if you are an owner of a Web 2.0 company.

The value produced by users of Web 2.0 services such as YouTube is captured by
capitalist investors. In some cases, the actual content they contribute
ultimately becomes the property of site owners. Private appropriation of
community-created value is a betrayal of the promise of sharing technology and
free co-operation. Unlike the dotcom boom era, where investors often financed
expensive capital acquisition, software development and content creation, a Web
2.0 investor finances marketing, the generation of hype and buzz. The
infrastructure is widely available for cheap, the content is free and the cost
of software, at least software that is not freely available, is negligible.
Basically, through providing some bandwidth and disk space, it is possible to
become a successful Web 2.0 site if you can market yourself effectively.

The principal success of a Web 2.0 company, then, comes from its relationship
to the community. More specifically, success comes from a company’s capacity to
‘harness collective intelligence’, as Tim O’Reilly puts it.xx From this
perspective, Web 1.0 companies were too monolithic and unilateral in their
approach to content. Success stories of the transition from Web 1.0 to 2.0 were
based on a company’s ability to remain monolithic in its branding of content,
or, better yet, in its ownership of that content, while opening up the creation
of content to the community. Yahoo!, for instance, created a portal to
community content while it remained the centralized location to find that
content. eBay allows the community to sell its goods while owning the
marketplace for those goods. Amazon, selling the same products as many other
sites, succeeded by allowing the community to participate in the ‘flow’ around
their products.

Because the capitalists who invest in Web 2.0 start-ups do not often fund early
capitalization, their behavior is markedly parasitic. Web 2.0 capitalists
frequently arrive late when value creation already has good momentum, swoop in
to take ownership, and use their financial power to promote the service, often
within the context of a hegemonic network of major, well-financed partners.
This means that companies not acquired by venture capital end up starved of
cash and squeezed out of the club.

In all these cases, the value of the internet site is created not by the paid
staff of the company who run it, but by the users who use it. With the emphasis
on community created content and sharing, it’s easy to overlook questions of
ownership of all this content, and the ability to monetize its value. These
questions rarely come up for the user. They are part of the fine print in their
Facebook Terms of Service agreement, or in the ‘flickr.com’ in the URL of their
photos. Ownership often isn’t an issue for the community, and is a small price
to pay for the use of these wonderful applications. Since most users do not
have access to alternative means to produce and publish their own content, they
are attracted to sites like Facebook and Flickr.

It should be added that many open source projects can be cited as the key
innovations in the development of Web 2.0: free software like Linux, Apache,
PHP, Ruby, Python, etc. are the backbone of Web 2.0, and the Web itself. But
there is a fundamental flaw with all of these projects in terms of what
O’Reilly refers to as the ‘core competencies’ of Web 2.0 companies, namely
control over unique, hard-to-recreate data sources that get richer as more
people use them, and the harnessing of the collective intelligence they
attract.xxi Allowing the community to contribute openly and to utilize that
contribution within the context of a proprietary system where the proprietor
owns the content is a characteristic of a successful Web 2.0 company. Allowing
the community to own what it creates, though, is not.

Thus, to be successful and create profits for investors, a Web 2.0 company
needs to create mechanisms for sharing and collaboration that are centrally
controlled. The lack of central control possessed by Usenet and other
peer-controlled technologies is, in the context of Web 2.0, a fundamental flaw.
They only benefit their users, not absentee investors, as they are not ‘owned’.
Thus, because Web 2.0 is funded by the same-old capitalism, Usenet is mostly
forgotten. While YouTube is worth a billion dollars, PeerCast, an innovative
P2P live video streaming network that has been in existence for several years
longer than YouTube, is virtually unknown.

From a technological standpoint, distributed and peer-to-peer technologies are
far more efficient than Web 2.0 systems. Making better use of network resources
by using the computers and network connections of users, peer-to-peer avoids
the bottlenecks created by centralized systems. It also allows content to be
published with less infrastructure, often no more than a computer and
a consumer internet connection. P2P systems do not require the massive data
centers of sites such as YouTube. Distributed systems also tend to have greater
longevity. Usenet has been subsumed in some way by Google, who owns the largest
Usenet archive and the most accessed Usenet web-based client, Google Groups.
However, because of the distributed nature of Usenet, other means of access
continue to exist in parallel, and while its role as an online platform has
lost prominence, many newsgroups remain active. For instance, the Church of The
SubGenius newsgroup, alt.slack, continues to be an important social forum for
the popular US-based mock religion. The lack of central infrastructure also
comes with a lack of central control, meaning an absence of censorship, often
a problem with privately-owned ‘communities’ that frequently bend to private
and public pressure groups and enforce limitations on the kinds of content they
allow. Also, the lack of large central cross-referencing databases of user
information has a strong advantage in terms of privacy.

From this perspective, it can be said that Web 2.0 is capitalism’s pre-emptive
attack against peer-to-peer systems. However, despite the many disadvantages in
comparison to P2P, Web 2.0 is more attractive to investors and thus has more
money to fund and promote centralized solutions. The end result is that
capitalist investment has flowed into centralized solutions, making them easy
and cheap or free for non-technical information producers to adopt. This ease
of access, compared to the technically challenging and expensive undertaking of
owning your own means of information production, has created a ‘landless’
proletariat ready to provide alienated content-creating labor for the new
info-landlords of Web 2.0. The mission of Web 2.0 is to destroy the P2P aspect
of the internet and to make you, your computer, and your internet connection
dependent on connecting to centralized services that control your ability to
communicate. Web 2.0 is the ruin of free, peer-to-peer systems and the return
of monolithic online services.

A telling detail here is that most home or office internet connections in the
90s, such as modem and ISDN connections, were symmetric, equal in their ability
to send and receive data. By design, these connections enable you to be equally
a producer and a consumer of information. On the other hand, modern DSL and
cable-modem connections are asymmetric, allowing you to download information
quickly but upload slowly. Moreover, many user agreements for internet services
forbid the user to run servers on a consumer account, and may cut off your
service if you do.

Capitalism, rooted in the idea of earning income by way of idle share
ownership, requires centralized control. Without such centralized control,
producers have no reason to share their income with outside shareholders. So
long as the financing of internet development resources comes from private
shareholders looking to capture value by owning internet resources, the network
will only become more restricted and centralized. While the information commons
has the potential to play a role in moving society toward more inclusive modes
of production, any real hope for a genuine, community enriching, next
generation of internet-based services is not rooted in the creation of more
privately owned, centralized resources, but rather in creating co-operative,
P2P and commons-based systems owned by everybody and nobody.

To reiterate, although small and obscure by today’s standards, with its focus
on peer-to-peer applications such as Usenet and email, the early internet was
very much a common, shared resource. The commercialization of the internet and
the emergence of capitalist financing has enabled the enclosure of this
information commons, translating public wealth into private profit. Thus Web
2.0 should not be thought of as a second generation of either the technical or
social development of the internet, but rather as the second wave of capitalist
enclosure of the information commons.

The third wave of enclosure of the information commons is already coming into
view. Cloud computing, provided by large corporations such as Google and
Amazon, where customers do not own the physical infrastructure they use, is
further centralizing the infrastructure of the internet. Additionally,
legislation, such as the ‘Telecoms Reform Package’xxii presented to the
European Parliament, seeks to make it possible for service providers (large
telecommunications conglomerates) to decide which websites their users are able
to access. Capital is showing us their vision of the future of the internet,
and the future looks a lot like CompuServe: monolithic, centralized, mediated,
controllable and exploitable, and naturally, operated by a few large
corporations.

Almost all of the most used internet resources could be replaced by
peer-to-peer alternatives. Google could be replaced by a P2P search system,
where every browser and every web server is an active node in the search
process; Flickr and YouTube could also be replaced by PeerCast, BitTorrent and
eDonkey-type applications, which allow users to use their own computers and
internet connections to collaboratively share pictures and videos. However,
developing internet resources requires the application of wealth, and so long
as the source of this wealth is venture capital, the great peer-to-peer
potential of the internet will remain unrealized. If we cannot find
alternatives to capitalist financing, we will not only lose the internet as we
know it, but also the chance to remake society in its P2P image.

Peer Production and the Poverty of Networks

A freer internet cannot exist within the present system of capitalist
financing. Arguments for the clear technical superiority of distributed
technologies over centralized ones have not been the deciding factors in the
ultimate development of our global communications infrastructure, which has
become more consolidated, regulated and restrictive. The determining factor is,
as always, the fact that those whose interests are served by restricting
freedom have more wealth at their disposal to relentlessly push toward their
ends than is available to resist them. The economic reasons for this are well
understood; the numerically small class of capitalists are the beneficiaries of
an unfair distribution of productive assets that allows them to capture the
wealth produced by the masses of property-less workers.

If we want to have a say in the way communication networks are operated, or if
we want to make any social reforms whatsoever, we must start by preventing
property owners from turning our productivity into their accumulated wealth.
The wealth they use to impose restrictions on our freedoms is the wealth they
have taken from us. Without us they would have no source of wealth. Even the
accumulated wealth from centuries of exploitation cannot ultimately save the
economic elite if they are unable to continue to capture current wealth. The
value of the future is far greater than the value of the past. Our ideas about
network topology are ultimately no threat to capitalism, who can always co-opt,
sabotage or simply ignore them. Rather, it is our new ways of working together
and sharing across national boundaries that have the potential to threaten the
capitalist order and bring about a new society.

Often discussions of the productive relations in free software projects and
other collaborative projects such as Wikipedia attempt to bottle up
commons-based production and trap it within the sphere of immaterial,
intangible production, restricting it exclusively to a domain where it cannot
affect wealth distribution and therefore play a role in class conflict. Yochai
Benkler, Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard Law School,
coined the term ‘peer production’ to describe the way free software, Wikipedia
articles, and similar works are produced. Limiting his analysis to the
so-called ‘networked information economy’, the novelty of peer production as
understood by Benkler and many others is that property in the commons is
entirely ‘non-rivalrous property’ that may be consumed by one person without
preventing others from also consuming it at the same time. This non-rivalrous
property could include broadcast radio, videos on the internet, or any network
transferable or accessible resources like free software. Such property has
virtually no reproduction costs. Also, another distinguishing feature of
Benkler's limited concept of peer production is that it is ‘non-reciprocal’,
meaning that producers do not receive direct remuneration for what they have
produced since their products are available for free. For example, users of
free software are not required to compensate the original developers.

There is no denying that Benkler’s wealthy network has a lot to offer. The
value of this information commons to its users is fantastic, as evidenced by
the millions who, for instance, use free software, Wikipedia, online
communications and social networking tools. However, if commons-based peer
production is limited exclusively to a commons made of digital property with
virtually no reproduction costs, how can the use-value produced be translated
into exchange-value? Where is the money to pay for the production of these
valuable things? Something with no reproduction costs can have no
exchange-value in the context of free exchange. Anybody who wants a copy can
obtain one from anybody that has one. But if what they produce has no
exchange-value, how can the peer producers be able to acquire the material
needs for their own subsistence?

The wealthy network exists within the context of a poor planet. The causes of
poverty are not a lack of culture or information, but the direct exploitation
of the producing class by the property-owning classes. The source of poverty is
not reproduction costs but rather extracted economic rents, surplus value
captured by way of forcing producers to accept less than the full product of
their labor as their wage by denying them independent access to the means of
production. So long as commons-based peer production is applied narrowly to
only an information commons, while the capitalist mode of production still
dominates the production of material wealth, owners of material property will
continue to capture the marginal wealth created as a result of the productivity
of the information commons. Whatever exchange value may be derived from the
information commons, will always be captured by the owners of real property,
which lies outside the commons.

For peer production to have any effect on general material wealth it has to
operate within the context of an overall system of goods and services, where
the physical means of production and the virtual means of production are both
available in the commons for peer production. By establishing a commons-based
peer production in the context of an information-only commons, Benkler is
creating a trap, ensuring the value created in the peer economy is appropriated
by property privilege. We have found Benkler standing on his head, and we will
need to redefine peer production to put his head above his feet again.

It is not the production in immaterial, non-reciprocal production that is
immaterial. Computers and networks, and developers and their places of work and
residence are all very much material and all require material upkeep. What is
immaterial is the distribution. Digitized information, source code or cultural
works can multiply and zip across global networks in fractions of a second, yet
production remains a very material affair. If peer production can only produce
immaterial goods such as software, and if producers get nothing in return for
such production, then this form of ‘production’ has no right to be called
a mode of production at all. First and foremost any mode of production must
account for its material inputs or else it will vanish. These inputs must
include the subsistence costs of its labor contributors, to, at a minimum,
‘enable the laborers, one with another, to subsist and to perpetuate their
race’, in the words of Ricardo.xxiii

Immaterial, non-reciprocal production cannot do so, since to produce free
software, free culture or free soup, producers must draw their subsistence from
some other source, and therefore immaterial, non-reciprocal production is not
a form of production at all, only a special case of distribution within another
form of production. Immaterial, non-reciprocal production is no more a mode of
production than a charity soup kitchen or socialized medicine. It is simply
a super-structural phenomenon that has another mode of production as its base,
capitalism.

Rather than placing emphasis on the immaterial distribution of what is produced
by current examples of peer production, we may note instead that such
production is characterized by independent producers employing a common stock
of productive assets. This view of peer production is not categorically limited
to immaterial goods. Understood this way, the concept of peer production, where
a network of peers apply their labor to a common stock for mutual and
individual benefit, certainly resonates with age-old proposed socialist modes
of production where a class-less community of workers (‘peers’) produce
collaboratively within a property-less (‘commons-based’) society. Unlike the
immaterial, non-reciprocal definition, this formulation can account for
material inputs, labor specialization and means of capital formation, and also
more closely relates to the topology of peer networks from which the term is
derived. This definition also more closely describes the production of free
software, Wikipedia, and other works commonly offered as being examples of peer
production.

Furthermore, this formulation is also better rooted in history, as it describes
historical examples of commons-based production, such as the pastoral commons.
As the distribution of productive assets is so much at the root of the
inequality of wealth and power that perpetuates exploitive systems, a mode of
production where productive assets are held in common is clearly a potentially
revolutionary one. However, if this form of production is contained to the
immaterial, if it can be categorized as immaterial by definition, then its
producers cannot capture any of the value they create. This, it is worth
noting, is precisely why Ivy League law professors and other elites prefer to
maintain this limitation. However, if we can implement ways of independently
sharing a common stock of material assets and thereby expand the scope of the
commons to include material as well as immaterial goods, then producers who
employ these assets in their production can retain a greater portion of their
product.

Peer production is distinct from other modes of production. Workers
independently employing a common stock of productive assets is a different
mode, distinct from both capitalist and collectivist approaches. The capitalist
mode of production is exploitive by nature; its fundamental logic is to capture
surplus value from labor by denying independent access to the means of
production. However, collectivist modes can also be exploitive. For instance in
co-operative production, in which producers collectively employ jointly owned
productive assets, the distribution of productive assets is likely to be unfair
among different co-operatives, allowing one to exploit the other. Larger scale
collectivist forms, such as socialist states or very big diversified
co-operatives, can be said to eliminate the sort of exploitation that can occur
between co-operatives. However, the expanding coordination layers needed to
manage these large organizations give rise to a coordinator class, a new class
consisting of a techno-administrative elite that has proven in historical
examples to have the capacity to be just as parasitic and stifling to workers
as a capitalist class.

A community of peer producers can grow without developing layers of
coordination because they are self-organizing and produce independently, and as
such they do not need any layers of management other than what is needed for
the provision of the common stock of productive assets. Thus, coordination is
limited to the allocation of the common stock among those who wish to employ
it. It is no surprise then that this sort of production has appeared and
flourished where the common stock is immaterial property, such as free
software, as the low reproduction costs eliminate allocation concerns. Thus
what is needed for peer production to be able to incorporate material goods
into the common stock is a system for allocating material assets among the
independent peers, which imposes only a minimal coordination burden. Venture
communism is such a way.

Venture Communism

Venture communism provides a structure for independent producers to share
a common stock of productive assets, allowing forms of production formerly
associated exclusively with the creation of immaterial value, such as free
software, to be extended to the material sphere. Part of the apparatus that
allowed the free software community to grow and spread was the creation of
copyleft, a type of license that allows for the re-use of the software it
covers, so long as the derived works are also licensed under compatible terms.
By releasing software under such licenses, the work becomes a collective stock
for all free software developers.

The core innovation of copyleft was to turn the copyright system against
itself. The chief vehicle of asserting control under copyright is the license
a work is released under, which establishes the terms under which others are
permitted to use the copyrighted material. Copyleft effectively hijacks the
existing apparatus that enforces privilege over intellectual assets, using the
authority granted by the copyright license to guarantee access for all, and
require that this freedom is passed on. This is consistent with copyright laws,
and dependent on them, because without copyright and the institutions that
protect it, there could be no copyleft.

Venture communism requires that this same freedom be extended to material
productive assets. The chief vehicle for asserting control over productive
assets is the firm. Venture communism is therefore based on a corporate form:
the venture commune. Employing a venture commune to share material property
hijacks the existing apparatus that enforces privilege, to instead protect
a common stock of productive assets that is available for use by independent
producers.

Legally, a venture commune is a firm, much like the venture capital funds of
the capitalist class. However, the venture commune has distinct properties that
transform it into an effective vehicle for revolutionary workers’ struggle. The
venture commune holds ownership of all productive assets that make up the
common stock employed by a diverse and geographically distributed network of
collective and independent peer producers. The venture commune does not
coordinate production; a community of peer producers produce according to their
own needs and desires. The role of the commune is only to manage the common
stock, making property, such as the housing and tools they require, available
to the peer producers.

The venture commune is the federation of workers' collectives and individual
workers, and is itself owned by each of them, with each member having only one
share. In the case that workers are working in a collective or co-operative,
ownership is held individually, by the separate people that make up the
collective or co-operative. Ownership in a venture commune can only be acquired
by contributions of labor, not property. Only by working is a share in the
commune earned, not by contributing land, capital or even money; only labor.
Property is always held in common by all the members of the commune, with the
venture commune equally owned by all its members. Thus, each member may never
accumulate a disproportionate share of the proceeds of property. Property can
never be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.

The function of the venture commune is to acquire material assets that members
need for living and working, such as equipment and tools, and allocate them to
its members. The commune acquires this property when requested to do so by
a member of the commune. The members interested in having this property offer
a rental agreement to the commune, giving the terms they wish to have for
possession of this property. The commune issues a series of bonds to raise the
funds required to acquire the property, which then becomes collateral for the
bondholders. The rental agreement is offered as a guarantee that the funds will
be available to redeem the bonds.

Should this guarantee not be met, the property can be liquidated with the
proceeds going to the bondholders. This series of bonds are sold in a public
auction setting. If the bond sale clears, the commune acquires the property,
and the rental agreement is executed transferring possession to the renter. The
property returns to the commune whenever those renting it no longer require it,
or are unable to meet the agreed terms, at which point the commune offers it
once again at auction to its members, who bid on new rental terms. If there is
no more demand for the asset it is liquidated. After the bonds that were issued
to acquire an asset are fully redeemed, it becomes fully owned by the commune.

The remaining rental income the property earns is from then on divided up
equally among all members of the commune and paid out to them. Proceeds from
liquidated property are likewise divided. Because all the rent collected from
property rental is divided up evenly among the members of the commune, those
members who pay rent for property that is equal to the amount they would
receive in return essentially get to use an equal share of the collectively
owned property for free. What they pay in rent for the property is equal to the
rent they receive back as a member of the commune. Members renting more than
their per-capita share of the collective property will pay more, and presumably
be choosing to pay because they are employing the property as a productive
asset, and thus earning enough to pay.

Conversely, members using less than their per-capita share receive more in
payment than they pay in rent, thus being rewarded for not hoarding property.
The main activities of the venture commune, managing bonds and rental
agreements, do not impose a high level of coordination and, just like the
computer networks that manage the allocation of immaterial goods, are
activities that are well suited for computerized automation. Many venture
communes could exist, and as they become interrelated, merge together forming
larger, and more stable and sustainable communities of commons-based producers.

Any change that can produce a more equitable society is dependent on a prior
change in the mode of production that increases the share of wealth retained by
the worker. The change in the mode of production must come first. This change
cannot be achieved politically, not by vote, or by lobby, or by advocacy, or by
revolutionary violence, not as long as the owners of property have more wealth
to apply to prevent any change by funding their own candidates, their own
lobbyists, their own advocates, and ultimately, developing a greater capacity
for counter-revolutionary violence. Society cannot be changed by a strike, not
    as long as owners of property have more accumulated wealth to sustain
    themselves during production interruptions. Not even collective bargaining
    can work, for so long as the owners of property own the product, they set
    the price of the product and thus any gains in wages are lost to rising
    prices.

Venture communism should not be understood as a proposal for a new kind of
society. It is an organizational form with which to engage in social struggle.
Venture communes are not intended to replace labor unions, political parties,
NGOs and other potential vehicles of class conflict, but to compliment them, to
tilt the economic balance of power in favor of the representatives of workers'
class interest. Without venture communism, these other organized forms are
always forced to work against opposition with much deeper pockets, and are thus
doomed to endless co-option, failure and retreat. The only way is to stop
applying our labor to property owned by non-producers and instead form a common
stock of productive assets.

Venture communism is taking control of our own productive process, retaining
the entire product of our labor, forming our own capital, and expanding until
we have collectively accumulated enough wealth to achieve a greater social
influence than those that defend exploitation. This new economic balance allows
for change that is far greater than the modest goals of venture communism.
    A truly free society would have no need for copyleft, or venture communism;
    these are only practices around which workers can unite towards the
    realization of their historic role of building a classless society,
    a society of equals.

Workers of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains. You have
a world to win.

The Manifesto of the Telekommunisten Network

Forked from text extracted from Section 2 of The Manifesto of the Communist
Party. Marx/Engels 1848.xxiv

The first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the
proletariat to the position of ruling class to develop a network of enterprises
where people produce for social value and share as equals, and to build and
expand the economic size of these enterprises to raise the organized
proletariat to the position of being the dominant economic class. Only when
workers control their own production can we win the battle of democracy.

The proletariat will use its political supremacy expanding economic power to
wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise decentralise
all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the
proletariat organised as the ruling class; into a common stock directly in the
hands of those whose production depends on it and to thereby increase the total
productive forces as rapidly as possible.

Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of
despotic inroads structuring our enterprises on the rights of property, and on
the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which
appear economically insufficient and untenable, and contrary to our ends, but
which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further
inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely
revolutionising the mode of production.

These measures will, of course, be different in different countries
communities.

Nevertheless, in most advanced countries communities, the following will be
pretty generally applicable.

1. (Abolition) Mutualization of property in (land) all instruments of
   production and application of all rents (of land) to (public) mutual
   purposes.

2. (A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.) Establishment of a guaranteed
   income in the form of a dividend paid to each member of the community equal
   in amount to their per-capita share of all mutually collected rent.

3. (Abolition of all rights of inheritance.) The right to membership of all who
   contribute their labor, and awarding of membership only by contribution of
   labor, not by inheritance, purchase or transfer of any kind.

4. (Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.) A binding
   agreement with all member enterprises to forgo all private ownership of
   their own productive assets, and instead take possession of what they need
   by renting it from the mutual common stock.

5. (Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national
   bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.) Establishment of
   a mutual bond market, where bonds are sold at auction for the purpose of
   building the common stock of productive assets.

6. (Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of
   the State.) Development of resources that put the means of communication and
   transport in the hands of all members.

7. (Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State;
   the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the
   soil generally in accordance with a common plan.) Provide to all enterprises
   the opportunity to acquire and extend the available instruments of
   production to the greatest degree possible.

8. (Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies,
   especially for agriculture.) Equal opportunity of all to participate and
   produce.

9. (Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition
   of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable
   distribution of the populace over the country.) Abolition of all the
   distinction between producers and consumers and the transformation of
   relations from market based transactions to generalized distribution, where
   production of social value takes precedent over the production of goods for
   sale.

10. (Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s
    factory labor in its present form. Combination of education with industrial
    production, &c, &c.) Establish knowledge and skill sharing networks and
    systems of support for all members, and provide opportunities to develop
    skills by contribution to production.

When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and
all production has been (concentrated) distributed in the hands of (a) vast
associations (of) spanning the whole (nation) world, the public power will lose
its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the
organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during
its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances,
to organise itself as a class, if, by means of (a revolution) self
organisation, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by
force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these
conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class
antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own
supremacy as a class.

In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms,
we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the
condition for the free development of all.

A Contribution to The Critique of Free Culture 

‘We are in the midst of a revolution in the way that knowledge and culture are
created, accessed and transformed’, states the ‘Charter for Innovation,
Creativity and Access to Knowledge’, something of a manifesto for the free
culture movement.xxv This revolution is against a system of copyright that
developed along with capitalism and has the exploitation of creators as its
basis. It is in the context of the great disparity of wealth and the struggle
between classes that any investigation of cultural production must be
understood.

Creating the conditions for the expropriation of creators has always been at
the root of copyright. This has been a subject of critique and dissent among
artists and authors as long as the notion of exclusive rights to ideas have
been around. This includes many who embrace complete opposition to copyright in
the form of anticopyright. The advent of digital culture and the popularity of
file sharing has brought certain forms of such dissent into the mainstream,
though often without the context of class struggle, and burdened by the common
misconception that copyright was at one time created in order to protect
cultural producers. This has led to projects like the Creative Commons, which
professes to promote the creation of a common culture, but actually limits
itself to promoting a more flexible model of private ownership.

As software production joined cultural production in the sphere of creating
reproducible digital material, new forms of dissent and organization have
emerged from the community of free software creators. The free software
movement, and in particular its tremendous commercial success, produced methods
and tools that have proven to be of great value to the free culture movement.
Yet the free software movement has also created misconceptions, as the
economics of goods intended for use by producers, such as software, are
different than consumer goods, such as books, movies and music. In order to
apply the powerful model of copyleft licenses, a form of licensing which
guarantees the freedom of derivatives of such work, the differing economics of
software and culture must be taken into account and made to be compatible with
the emancipation of the working class broadly. Free culture cannot be
sustainable in an unfree society that requires consumer goods to capture
profits. Free culture can only be realized within the context of a free
society.

While copyleft is very effective in creating a commons of software, to achieve
a commons of cultural works requires copyfarleft, a form of free licensing that
denies free access to organizations that hold their own assets outside the
commons.

Copyright is a System of Censorship and Exploitation

The existence of ‘copy rights’ predates 18th century notions of the author’s
right to ownership.xxvi From the 16th to the 17th century royal licenses gave
exclusive rights to certain publishers to print particular texts. In 1557, an
exclusive printing monopoly was granted through a Royal Charter to a London
guild of printers, the Stationers’ Company, because it assured Crown control
over which books were published or banned. The first copyrights were
publisher’s rights to print copies, emerging out of the ideological needs of
absolutist monarchies to control knowledge and censor dissent.

After the Licensing Act expired in 1694, the monopoly of the Stationers’
Company was threatened by provincial booksellers, the so-called ‘pirates’ from
Ireland and Scotland. The Stationers’ Company petitioned Parliament for a new
bill to extend their copyright monopoly. But this was a different England from
1557, different from the Parliament that had executed King Charles I in 1649,
abolished the monarchy and installed a republic under Cromwell, restored the
monarchy with Charles II, overthrew James II in the Revolution of 1688, and, in
1689, passed the first decree of modern constitutional sovereignty, the Bill of
Rights. This was now John Locke’s England.

The philosopher John Locke was among the chief architects of the liberal state
and the ideology of private property. To Locke, property was an extension of
one’s ownership of oneself. Since you own yourself, you therefore own what you
produce. The right to property is created by labor. The English Parliament now
took a view consistent with this outlook, and The Statute of Anne, enacted in
1709 by Parliament, proved to be a hard blow against the Stationers’ Company.
The Statute declared authors, not publishers, to be owners of their works and
limited the copyright term to 14 years for new books and 21 years for existing
copyrights. The Statute, which was subtitled ‘An Act for the Encouragement of
Learning, by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers
of such Copies, During the Times Therein Mentioned’, created a marketplace for
knowledge through competition. The Statute’s aim was not to create an author’s
copyright, but to break the Stationers’ Company’s monopoly.

The principal players, in what the press hailed as the great cause of literary
property, were not authors. Publishers sued each other in the courts, invoking
the author’s rights as a pretext in their battle for economic power. The notion
of the author as an originator, with a natural right to own their ideas, may
have been invented by artists and philosophers, but it was publishers who
profited. Laws are not made by poets but by states, and states exist to enforce
economic privilege, adopting whatever legitimizing philosophical framework they
find convenient at any given time. The Statute of Anne codified the capitalist
form of the author-publisher relationship. Authors had a right to own the
products of their labor in theory, but since they created immaterial ideas and
lacked the technological means to produce books, they had to sell their rights
to another party with enough capital to exploit them. In essence, it was no
different than any other sale of labor. The exploitation of the author was
embedded in the intellectual property regime from its inception.

There are important differences between intellectual property and physical
property. Physical property is scarce and finite, while intellectual property
can be copied, often costs almost nothing to reproduce, and can be used
simultaneously by anyone with a copy. It is exactly this characteristic of
unlimited reproducibility that requires the copyright regime to make
information into property. In the long term, the exchange value of any
reproducible good is driven towards its reproduction cost by competition. Since
there are few barriers to reproducing an information asset, it can have no
exchange value beyond the labor and resources required to reproduce it. In
other words, information has no long-term exchange value of its own. Thus,
owners of this property (again, not to be confused with the producers) need
laws to prevent this reproduction.

Only by making it illegal for others to reproduce the information can owners
extract rent for the right to copy. Intellectual property, including copyright,
is an extension of the structure of property to immaterial assets and
information. Copyright is a legal construction that tries to make certain kinds
of immaterial wealth behave like material wealth so that they can be owned,
controlled, and traded.

In any system of property, musicians can no more retain ownership of the
product of their labor than can workers at a textile sweatshop. The system of
private control of the means of publication, distribution, promotion and media
production ensures that artists and all other creative workers can earn no more
than their subsistence. Whether you are a biochemist, a musician, a software
engineer, or a filmmaker, you have signed over all your copyrights to property
owners before these rights have any real financial value, for no more than the
reproduction costs of your work.

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, nineteenth century French socialist and the first
person to call himself an ‘anarchist’, famously argued that property is theft.
According to this logic, if property is theft, than intellectual property is
fraud. Property is theft not in a strictly legal sense, since the laws of the
liberal capitalist state are the foundations of property. Property is theft in
the philosophical sense, as in the Lockean concept of property as an extension
of self-ownership, meaning that it is intrinsically unjust to take what you
have not produced. Proudhon, like Thompson and Hodgskin before him, argues that
the owner of property has no legitimate claim to the product of those who put
their property to productive use.xxvii Without recourse to force, property
owners could not extract any more than the reproduction costs of the
instruments they contribute to the productive process. A capitalist class,
then, could not exist without denying workers independent access to the means
of production.

In the words of American Individualist Anarchist Benjamin Tucker, ‘the lender
of capital is entitled to its return intact, and nothing more’.xxviii Since
common lands were previously not property, when the peasants of the
pre-industrial age were denied access to common land by new enclosures, it can
be said that their land was stolen. Furthermore, because they were forced into
wage labor as a result of this expropriation, the institution of property
itself is an institution of theft.

But if physical property can be stolen, can intelligence or ideas be stolen? If
your land is stolen, you cannot use it anymore, except on the conditions set by
its new private owner. If ownership of an idea is analogous to the ownership of
material property, it should be subject to the same conditions of economic
exchange, forfeiture, and seizure. And if seized, it would then cease to be the
property of its owner. But if your idea is used by others, you have not lost
your ability to use it, so what is really stolen? The traditional notion of
property, as something that can be possessed to the exclusion of others, is
irreconcilable with something as intangible as an idea. Unlike a material
object, which can exist in only one place at a given time, ideas are infinite
and non-exclusive. A poem is no less a poet’s poem, despite its existence in
the memories of a thousand others.

Every expression is an extension of a previous perception. Ideas are not
original, they are built upon layers of knowledge accumulated throughout
history. Out of these common layers artists create works that have their
unmistakable specificities and innovations. All creative works reassemble
ideas, words, and images from history and their contemporary context. Before
the 18th century, poets quoted their ancestors and sources of inspiration
without formal acknowledgement, and playwrights freely borrowed plots and
dialogue from previous sources without attribution. Homer based the ‘Iliad’ and
the ‘Odyssey’ on oral traditions that dated back centuries. Virgil’s ‘Aeneid’
is lifted heavily from Homer. Shakespeare borrowed many of his narrative plots
and dialogue from Holinshed.

This is not to say that the concept of plagiarism didn’t exist before the 18th
century, but its definition shifted radically. The term plagiarist (literally,
kidnapper) was first used by Martial in the 1st century to describe someone who
kidnapped his poems by copying them whole and circulating them under the
copier’s name. Plagiarism was a false assumption of another’s work. But if
a new work had similar passages or identical expressions to earlier ones, it
was not considered such a false assumption, as long as the new work had its own
aesthetic merits. After the invention of the creative genius, practices of
collaboration, appropriation and transmission were actively forgotten. The
accusations of plagiarism directed at Coleridge, Stendhall, Wilde and T.S.
Eliot for including expressions from their predecessors in their works
reflected a modern redefinition of the term in accordance with modern notions
of authorship and exclusive property.

Ideas are viral. They couple with other ideas, change shape, and migrate into
unfamiliar territories. Regimes of intellectual property restrict the
promiscuity of ideas and trap them in artificial enclosures, extracting
exclusive benefits from their ownership and control. Intellectual property is
fraud, a legal privilege to falsely represent oneself as the sole ‘owner’ of an
idea, expression or technique and to charge a tax to all who want to perceive,
express or apply this ‘property’ in their own productive practice. It is not
plagiarism that dispossesses an ‘owner’ of using an idea, it is intellectual
property, backed by the invasive violence of a state that dispossesses everyone
from the use of their common culture.

The basis for this dispossession is the legal fiction of the author as
a sovereign individual who creates original works out of the wellspring of his
imagination and thus has a natural and exclusive right to ownership. Foucault
unmasked authorship as a functional principle that impedes the free
circulation, manipulation, composition, decomposition, and re-composition of
knowledge.xxix The author-function represents a form of despotism over the
proliferation of ideas. The effect of this despotism, and of the system of
intellectual property that it shelters and preserves, is that it robs us of our
cultural memory, censors our words, and chains our imagination to the law. And
yet artists continue to be flattered by their association with the myth of the
creative genius, turning a blind eye to how it is used to justify their
exploitation and expand the privilege of the property-owning elite.

Copyright pits author against author in a war of competition for originality.
Its effects are not just economic; copyright also naturalizes a certain process
of knowledge production, de-legitimizes the notion of a common culture, and
cripples social relations. Artists are not encouraged to share their thoughts,
expressions and works, or to contribute to a common pool of creativity.
Instead, they are compelled to jealously guard their ‘property’ from others who
they view as potential competitors, spies and thieves lying in wait to snatch
and defile their original ideas. This is a vision of the art world created in
capitalism’s own image, a capitalism that seeks to appropriate the alienated
products of its intellectual and creative workers.

Joost Smiers, Professor Emeritus of Political Science of the Arts at the
Utrecht School of the Arts, is among those who insist on the abolition of
copyright. He argues that copyright centralizes media ownership by giving large
media conglomerates an anti-competitive advantage that damages the position of
artists. Artists would gain more from a level playing field consisting of
a larger number of publishers competing for their services, than from the
exclusivity of copyright.xxx Professor Smiers has a valid point regarding the
market inefficiency of copyright. Copyright should be abolished. However, there
is no reason to believe it will be abolished.

Copyright is far from the only market inefficiency in the contemporary
capitalist market. Without market inefficiencies, capital would be unable to
capture any more than its own reproduction cost in any branch of industry. The
elimination of competition is central to the logic of capitalism. Without
unfair advantages, a capitalist class of owners could not accumulate wealth and
there could be no capitalism. Smiers is correct in his criticism of copyright,
he is also correct when he goes further and denounces copyright as a form of
censorship. However as with all political ideas, the abolition of copyright can
only be implemented when those who support it can overcome the wealth of those
who oppose it. This is not currently the case.

The private ownership of ideas over the last two centuries has not managed to
eradicate the memory of a common culture, or the recognition that knowledge
flourishes when ideas, words, sounds and images are free for everyone to use.
Ever since the birth of the proprietary author, different individuals and
groups have challenged the intellectual property regime and the ‘right’ it gave
to some private individuals to ‘own’ creative works while preventing others
from using and re-interpreting them.

In his 1870 ‘Poesies’, a pair of texts discovered and revered by Surrealists
Louis Aragon and André Breton, Uruguayan-born French poet Comte de Lautreamont
called for a return of impersonal poetry, a poetry written by all. ‘Plagiarism
is necessary’, Lautreamont stated, ‘progress depends on it. It sticks close to
an author's phrase, uses his expressions, deletes a false idea, replaces it
with a true one’.xxxi His definition subverted the myth of individual
creativity used to justify property relations, in the name of progress, where
the myth of individual creativity in fact impeded progress through the
privatization of culture. The natural response was to re-appropriate culture as
a sphere of collective production without acknowledging artificial enclosures
of authorship. Lautremont’s phrase became a benchmark for the 20th century
avant-gardes. Dada rejected originality and portrayed all artistic production
as recycling and reassembling, from Duchamp’s ready-mades to Tzara’s rule for
making poems from cut-up newspapers, to the photomontages of Höch, Hausmann and
Heartfield. Dada also challenged the idea of the artist as solitary genius, and
of art as a separate sphere, by working collectively to not only produce art
objects and texts, but also media hoaxes, interventions at political gatherings
and demonstrations on the street. Its assault on artistic values was a revolt
against the capitalist foundations that created them.

The ideas of Dadaism were systematically developed into a theory by the
Situationist International (SI). The SI acknowledged that the practice of
detournement, putting existing artworks, films, advertisements and comic strips
through a detour, or recoding their dominant meanings, was indebted to Dadaist
practices, but with a difference. They saw Dada as a negative critique of
dominant images (one that depended on the easy recognition of the image being
negated) and defined detournement as a positive reuse of existing fragments
simply as elements in the production of a new work. Detournement was not
primarily an antagonism to tradition; rather, it emphasized the reinvention of
a new world from the scraps of the old. And implicitly, revolution was not
primarily an insurrection against the past but a way of learning to live in
a different way by creating new practices and forms of behavior. These forms of
behavior included collective writings, which were often unsigned, and an
explicit refusal of the copyright regime by attaching the labels ‘no copyright’
or ‘anticopyright’ to their works, along with the directions for use, such as:
any of the texts in this book may be freely reproduced, translated or adapted
even without mentioning the source.

Digitalization has proven to be much more of a threat to conventional notions
of authorship and intellectual property than the plagiarism practiced by
radical artists, or critiques of the author by poststructuralist theorists. The
computer dissolves the boundaries essential for the modern fiction of the
author as a solitary creator of unique and original works. Ownership
presupposes a separation between texts, and between the author and reader. The
artificiality of this separation is becoming more apparent. On mailing lists,
newsgroups and open publishing sites, the transition from reader to writer is
natural, and the difference between original texts vanishes as readers
contribute commentary and incorporate fragments of the original in their
response without the use of quotations. Attempts to copyright online writing
appear increasingly absurd, as such, texts are often collectively produced and
immediately multiplied. As online information circulates without regard for the
conventions of copyright, the concept of the proprietary author really seems to
have become a ghost of the past. Perhaps the most important effect of
digitalization is that it threatens the traditional benefactors of intellectual
property since monopolistic control by book publishers, music labels and the
film industry is no longer necessary as ordinary people are taking up the means
of production and distribution for themselves.

The Creative Anti-Commons

The emergence of free software, file sharing, and art forms based upon sampling
and reuse of other media has created a serious problem for the traditional
copyright system. The music and film industries, in particular, are in the
middle of what basically amounts to an all-out war against their own consumers
to prevent them from downloading and sampling their property, their copyrights.
It is clear that digital network technologies poses a serious problem for the
recording and film industries. Dissent from copyright restrictions has had
a rich history among avant-garde artists, zine producers, radical musicians,
and the subcultural fringe. Today, the fight against intellectual property is
led by lawyers, professors and members of government. Not only is the social
strata to which the leading players belong very different, a fact that, in
itself might not be such a particularly important detail, but the framework for
the struggle against intellectual property has completely changed. 

Before law professors like Lawrence Lessig became interested in intellectual
property, the discourse among dissidents was against any ownership of the
commons, intellectual or physical. Now, supporters of property and economic
privilege occupy centre stage. The argument is no longer that the author is
a fiction and that property is theft, but that intellectual property law needs
to be restrained and reformed because it now infringes upon the rights of
creators. Lessig criticizes the recent changes in copyright legislation imposed
by global media corporations and their powerful lobbies, the absurd lengths to
which copyright has been extended, and other perversions that restrict the
creativity of artists. But he does not question copyright as such, since he
views it as the most important incentive for artists to create. The objective
here is to defend against intellectual property extremism, and absolutism,
while preserving its beneficial effects.

In his keynote at Wizards of OS4 in Berlin, Lessig celebrated the read-write
culture of free sharing and collaborative authorship that has been the norm for
most of history. During the last century, as Lessig explained, this read-write
culture has been thwarted by intellectual property legislation and converted to
a read-only culture, dominated by a regime of producer-control.xxxii Lessig
bemoans the recent travesties of copyright law that have censored the work of
remix artists like DJ Danger Mouse (The Grey Album) and Javier Prato (Jesus
Christ: The Musical). Both artists were torpedoed by the legal owners of the
music used in the production of their works, as were John Oswald and
Negativland before them. In these cases, the wishes of the artists, rendered
here as mere consumers in the eyes of the law, were subordinated to control by
the producers - the Beatles and Gloria Gaynor, respectively - and their legal
representatives. The problem is that producer-control is creating a read-only
culture and destroying the vibrancy and diversity of creative production. It is
promoting the narrow interests of a few privileged ‘producers’ at the expense
of everybody else.

Lessig contrasts producer-control to the cultural commons (a common stock of
value that all can use and contribute to). The commons denies producer-control
and insists on the freedom of consumers. The ‘free’ in free culture refers to
the natural freedom of consumers to use common cultural stock, and not the
state-enforced freedom of producers to control the use of ‘their’ work. In
principle, the notion of a cultural commons abolishes the distinction between
producers and consumers, viewing them as equal actors in an ongoing process.

Today, within the context of the Creative Commons (CC) project more
specifically, Lessig claims that the possibility of a read-write culture is
reborn. But is the Creative Commons really a commons? According to its website,
Creative Commons defines the spectrum of possibilities between full copyright
(all rights reserved) and the public domain (no rights reserved). Creative
Commons also offers licenses that help you keep your copyright while inviting
certain uses of your work, a ‘some rights reserved’ copyright. The point is
clear: Creative Commons exists to help ‘you’, the producer, keep control of
‘your’ work. You are invited to choose from among a range of restrictions you
wish to apply to ‘your’ work, such as forbidding duplication, forbidding
derivative works, or forbidding commercial use. It is assumed that, as an
author-producer, everything you make and everything you say is your property.
The right of the consumer is not mentioned, nor is the distinction between
producers and consumers of culture disputed. Creative Commons legitimizes,
rather than denies, producer-control and enforces, rather than abolishes, the
distinction between producer and consumer. It expands the legal framework for
producers to deny consumers the possibility to create use-value or
exchange-value out of the common stock.

This problem of creating ‘commons deeds’ for works that are not really a common
stock is typical of the copy-just-right approach typified by the Creative
Commons. Had the Beatles and Gloria Gaynor published their work within the
framework of Creative Commons, it would still be their choice, and not the
choice of DJ Danger Mouse or Javier Patro, whether The Grey Album or Jesus
Christ: The Musical should be allowed to exist. The legal representatives of
the Beatles and Gloria Gaynor could just as easily have used CC licenses to
enforce their control over the use of their work. The very problem of
producer-control presented by Lessig is not solved by the Creative Commons
‘solution’ as long as the producer has an exclusive right to choose the level
of freedom to grant the consumer, a right that Lessig has never questioned. The
Creative Commons mission of allowing producers the ‘freedom’ to choose the
level of restrictions for publishing their work contradicts the real conditions
of commons-based production. Lessig has no basis to use DJ Danger Mouse and
Javier Patro as examples to promote the cause of Creative Commons.

Likewise, Lessig’s praise of the free software movement rings false, because
its architecture assures everyone (technologically as well as legally, in the
form of its licenses) the possibility of using the common resource of the
source code. Despite its claim to be extending the principles of the free
software movement, the freedom Creative Commons gives to creators to choose how
their works are used is very different from the freedom the General Public
License, invented by free software guru Richard Stallman, gives to users to
copy, modify and distribute the software as long as the same freedom is passed
down. Stallman recently made a statement rejecting Creative Commons in its
entirety, because some of its licenses are free while others are non-free,
arguing that this confuses people into mistaking the common label for something
substantial, when in fact there is no common standard and no ethical position
behind the label.xxxiii

Whereas copyleft claims ownership legally, only to relinquish it practically,
the references to ownership by Creative Commons are genuine, not ironic.
Creative Commons’ pick-and-choose licenses allow arbitrary restrictions on the
freedom of users based on an author’s particular preferences and tastes. In
this sense, Creative Commons is a more elaborate version of copyright. It
doesn’t challenge the copyright regime as a whole, nor does it preserve its
legal shell in order to turn the practice of copyright on its head, as copyleft
does.

The public domain, anticopyright and copyleft are all attempts to create
a commons, a shared space of non-ownership that is free for everyone to use.
The conditions of use may differ, according to various interpretations of
rights and responsibilities, but these rights are common rights, and the
resources are shared alike by the whole community. Their use is not granted
arbitrarily on a case-by-case basis according to the whims of individual
members, such as with the Creative Commons approach. The Creative Commons'
mixed bag of cultural goods is not held in common, because it is the choice of
individual authors to permit their use, or to deny it. Thus, Creative Commons
is an anti-commons that peddles a capitalist logic of privatization under
a deliberately misleading name. Its purpose is to help the owners of
‘intellectual property’ catch up with the fast pace of information exchange,
not by freeing information, but by providing more sophisticated definitions for
various shades of ownership and producer-control.

What began as a movement for the abolition of intellectual property has become
a movement of customizing owners’ licenses. Almost without notice, what was
once a threatening movement of radicals, hackers and pirates is now the domain
of reformists, revisionists, and apologists for capitalism. When capital is
threatened, it co-opts its opposition. We have seen this scenario many times
throughout history. Indeed, one of the most spectacular examples of such
a co-optation is the transformation of self-organized workers’ councils into
a trade union movement that negotiates legal contracts with the owners of
corporations. The Creative Commons is a similar subversion that does not
question the ‘right’ to private property, but tries instead to get small
concessions in a playing field where the game and its rules are determined in
advance. The real effect of Creative Commons is to narrow political
contestation within the sphere of the already permissible.

While narrowing this field of contestation, Creative Commons simultaneously
portrays itself as radical, as the avant-garde of the battle against
intellectual property. Creative Commons has become a kind of default orthodoxy
in non-commercial licensing, and a popular cause among artists and
intellectuals who consider themselves generally on the left, and against the
intellectual property regime in particular.

The Creative Commons label is moralistically invoked on countless sites, blogs,
speeches, essays, artworks and pieces of music as if it constituted the
necessary and sufficient condition for the coming revolution of a truly ‘free
culture’. Creative Commons is part of a larger copyfight movement, which is
defined as a fight to abolish ‘intellectual property’ and return to the mythic
principles of pre-corrupted copyright law that ‘genuinely’ sought to protect
authors' rights. The individuals and groups associated with this movement
advocate what has been called a ‘smarter intellectual property’ or a reform of
intellectual property that doesn’t threaten free speech, democracy,
competition, innovation, education, the progress of science, and other things
that are critically important to our social, cultural, and economic well-being.

In an uncanny repetition of the copyright struggles that first emerged during
the period of Romanticism, the excesses of the capitalist form of intellectual
property are opposed through using capital’s own language and presuppositions.
Creative Commons preserves Romanticism’s ideas of originality, creativity and
property rights, and similarly considers ‘free culture’ to be a separate sphere
existing in splendid isolation from the world of material production. Ever
since the 18th century, the ideas of ‘creativity’ and ‘originality’ have been
inextricably linked to an anti-commons of knowledge. Creative Commons is no
exception. This view of the copyfight movement, a movement that includes
Creative Commons, is inconsistent with the idea of ‘free’ in the history of
free culture. For instance, the journal Internationale Situationniste, existing
between the late 1950s and early 1970s, was published with the following
copyright statement: ‘All texts published in Internationale Situationniste may
be freely reproduced, translated or adapted, even without indication of
origin’.xxxiv

Even earlier, in a 1930’s Woody Guthrie songbook distributed to listeners who
wanted the words to his recordings, the following note was included:

This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright #154085, for a period
of 28 years, and anybody caught singin’ it without our permission, will be
mighty good friends of ours, cause we don’t give a dern. Publish it. Write it.
Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that’s all we wanted to do.xxxv

In these cases, what is evident is that the freedom insisted upon is the
freedom of the consumer to use and produce, not the ‘freedom’ of the producer
to control. If free culture is really intended to create a common stock for
cultural peer production, then the framework provided must specifically be
designed in such a way that it cannot be used to attack free culture. The terms
presented by Woody Guthrie and the Situationist International pass this test.
The Creative Commons does not. Moreover, proponents of free culture must be
firm in denying the right of producer-control and denying the enforcement of
a distinction between producer and consumer.

Free Software: Copyright Eats Itself

If copyable information is made scarce only by law, it can also be made
abundant by law. The practice of using copyright law itself as a form of
dissent against copyright, called copyleft, grew to prominence in software
development and in the rise of the free software community.

The General Public License (GPL) was the first copyleft license under which
a large amount of free software has been released. Its inventor Richard
Stallman claims that in the age of the digital copy, the role of copyright has
been completely reversed. While it began as a legal measure to allow authors to
restrict publishers for the sake of the general public, copyright has become
a publisher’s weapon to maintain their monopoly by imposing restrictions on
a general public that now has the means to produce their own copies. The aim of
copyleft more generally, and of specific licenses like the GPL, is to reverse
this reversal.

Copyleft uses copyright law, but flips it over to serve the opposite of its
usual purpose. Instead of fostering privatization, it becomes a guarantee that
everyone has the freedom to use, copy, distribute and modify software or any
other work. Its only ‘restriction’ is precisely the one that guarantees
freedom, and that users are not permitted to restrict anyone else’s freedom
since all copies and derivations must be redistributed under the same license.
Copyleft claims ownership legally, only to relinquish it practically, by
allowing everyone to use the work as they choose as long as the copyleft is
passed down. The merely formal claim of ownership means that no one else may
put a copyright over a work that has a copyleft, to try and limit its use.

Copyleft licenses guarantee intellectual property freedom by requiring that the
reuse and redistribution of information is governed by ‘the four freedoms’ of
the Free Software Foundation. These are the freedoms to use, study, modify and
redistribute.xxxvi Seen in its historical context, copyleft lies somewhere
between copyright and anticopyright. The gesture by writers of anticopyrighting
their works was made in a spirit of generosity, affirming that knowledge can
flourish only when it has no owners. As a declaration of ‘no rights reserved’,
anticopyright was a perfect slogan launched in an imperfect world. The
assumption was that others would be using the information in the same spirit of
generosity. But corporations learned to exploit the lack of copyright and
redistribute works for a profit.

Stallman came up with the idea of copyleft in 1984 after a company made
improvements to software he had placed in the public domain (the technical
equivalent of anticopyright, but without the overt gesture of critique),
privatized the source code and refused to share the new version. So in a sense,
copyleft represents a coming-of-age, a painful lesson that relinquishing all
rights can lead to abuse by profiteers. Copyleft attempts to create a commons
based on reciprocal rights and responsibilities; those who want to share common
resources have certain ethical obligations to respect the rights of other
users. Everyone can add to the commons, but no one may subtract from it.

But in another sense copyleft represents a step back from anticopyright, and is
plagued by a number of contradictions. Stallman’s position is in agreement with
a widespread consensus that copyright has been perverted into a tool that
benefits corporations rather than the authors for whom it was originally
intended. But importantly, no such golden age of copyright exists. Copyright
has always been a legal tool. By coupling texts to authors, it transformed
ideas into commodities to turn a profit for the owners of capital.

This specific myopia about copyright is part of a more general non-engagement
with economic questions. The ‘left’ in copyleft resembles a vague sort of
libertarianism opposed to closed, nontransparent systems and totalitarian
restrictions on access to information, rather than economic privilege or the
exploitation of labor. Copyleft emerged out of a hacker ethic that comes
closest to the pursuit of knowledge for knowledge’s sake. Its main objective is
defending freedom of information against restrictions imposed by ‘the system’,
which in part explains why there’s such a wide range of political opinions
among hackers. It also explains why the commonality that links hackers together
- the ‘left’ in Stallman’s vision of copyleft - is not the left as it is
understood by most political activists.

The GPL and copyleft is frequently invoked as an example of the free software
movement’s anticommercial bias. But there is no such bias. The four freedoms
required by the GPL means that any additional restriction, like
a non-commercial clause, would designate the work as non-free even if it
complies with some of the freedoms. Keeping software ‘free’ does not prevent
developers from selling copies they’ve modified with their own labor, and it
also does not prevent redistribution by a commercial company that charges
a fee, as long as the same license is passed down and the source code remains
transparent.

This version of freedom does not abolish exchange, as some free software
enthusiasts have claimed, nor is it even incompatible with a capitalist economy
based on the theft of surplus value. The contradiction inherent in this commons
is partly due to the understanding of proprietary as synonymous with
closed-source or non-transparent. ‘Proprietary’ means having an owner who
prohibits access to information and keeps the source code secret, it does not
necessarily mean having an owner who extracts a profit, although keeping the
source code secret and extracting a profit often coincide in practice. As long
as the four conditions are met, commercial redistribution of free software is
non-proprietary.

Virtually every office, every academy, and every factory relies on software in
their day-to-day work. For all these organizations, the use-value of software
can be directly translated into exchange-value in the course of their normal
production, not by selling the software directly, but by doing whatever
business they do, selling whatever product they sell, and using software to
increase their productivity. Paying for software licenses and agreeing to the
restrictive terms of such licenses is not in their interests. As a comparison
to what David Ricardo said regarding landlords, the interest of a software
company like Microsoft is always opposed to the interest of every software
user.

The organizations that use software, namely schools, factories, offices, and
e-commerce enterprises, collectively employ far more software developers within
their organizations than the few companies who sell proprietary software, such
as Microsoft. Thus, free software is very attractive to these organizations as
it allows them to reduce their individual development costs by collectively
maintaining a common stock of software assets. Thus, the use-value of free
software is valued by organizations that can and do pay software developers to
make it, even though they have no exclusive copyright on it. In endorsing free
software and copyleft in order to reduce their own costs of production,
technology giants like IBM have much in common with liberal capitalists like
David Ricardo, who worked to overcome the advantages landlords had over
capitalists through, for instance, working to lower the price of their means of
production.

Yet free software was not conceived as merely a way to reduce the cost of
corporate software development. Richard Stallman writes on his organization’s
website: ‘My work on free software is motivated by an idealistic goal:
spreading freedom and co-operation. I want to encourage free software to
spread, replacing proprietary software that forbids co-operation, and thus make
our society better’.xxxvii However, since free software cannot directly capture
exchange value, producers of free software must still sell their labor to
provide for their material subsistence. Copyleft is thus not able to ‘make
society better’ in any material sense, as the majority of the exchange value
created by producers of free software is captured by owners of material
property who are able to provide for their subsistence. As copyleft cannot
allow workers to accumulate wealth beyond customary subsistence, copyleft alone
cannot change the distribution of productive assets or their output. Therefore
copyleft has no direct impact on the distribution of wealth and power.

Not all free software is copyleft. All software licensed under the terms that
provide the four freedoms of the Free Software Foundation is free software.
Software is copyleft when, in addition, it proscribes that all derivative works
also pass on these freedoms. The question then must be asked, to what degree
copyleft really does benefit the free software movement?

Despite examples such as Stallman’s formative experience, when his public
domain software was appropriated and privatized in 1984, there are also ample
counter examples of large-scale free software projects that continue to employ
licenses that allow proprietary redistribution, such as various BSD-based
operating systems and the hugely popular Apache web server. While a corporation
can employ code from these projects in proprietary applications, it does so at
a cost. By separating their development from the main free software project,
they have to manually patch or re-implement code improvements from the free
distribution into their own fork, and forgo help from the free software
community in improving their own proprietary contributions. This means that
companies that chose to make proprietary versions of free software need
a strong business reason to do so. In practice then, this rarely happens, as
proprietary versions tend to quickly fall behind the free software versions in
functionality and thus lose their market value.

The most successful examples of proprietary use of free software comes from
companies whose primary business is selling hardware, not software, such as
Apple Computer or Juniper routers, both of which run proprietary versions of
software derived from BSD-based projects. It should be noted that both Apple
and Juniper make their software proprietary not to sell software, but to bundle
it with their expensive hardware. This point is emphasized by the efforts of
both companies to stop users from legally buying the software to run on cheaper
commodity hardware. For example, consider Apple's efforts to thwart the
Hackintosh project which offers instructions on getting Mac operating systems
onto unsupported computers, as well as legal action against companies selling
non-Apple hardware preloaded with legally purchased copies of its OS X.xxxviii

Examples like this demonstrate the emphasis on freedom embedded within
copyleft. Apple’s actions have not threatened the BSD-based free software
projects they have drawn from. In fact, Apple has contributed to these
projects. However, the terms of the BSD-style license allows Apple to add
restrictions that enable them to control their users and deny their freedom in
using their legally purchased software as they please. They would not have such
an option if their operating system was based on copyleft licensed software
such as Linux, which is published under the GPL.

Just as copyleft is in some ways a retreat from the ideological position of
anticopyright, the political position of copyleft is very much a retreat from
the ideological position of the socialist left. Even when it appropriates
arguments against property from the left, copyleft limits the critiques to the
narrow field of immaterial property. A particularly shameless example of this
is Eben Moglen’s ‘dot Communist Manifesto’,xxxix an insulting pastiche of Marx
and Engels’ seminal manifesto, that invokes the 1848 call to arms for the
working class to unite towards the abolition of capitalism only to instead
demand for the abolition of intellectual property alone. The two 19th-century
materialists would have understood that abolishing intellectual property would
not free the working class of their chains. Moglen, Columbia University law
professor and chief counsel for Stallman’s Free Software Foundation, fails to
engage with the issue of the institution of property itself, and thus has
learned nothing from the position of the revolutionaries he smugly mimics.

Yet, despite the ideological and political retreats that copyleft represents,
in the area of software development, copyleft has proved to be a tremendously
effective means of creating an information commons that broadly benefits all
those whose production depends on it. Indeed, the rise of the free software
movement is rightly an inspiration to all who strive towards more equitable
forms of producing.

The socialist left promotes the idea that wealth must be more justly and
equitably shared and controlled by the people who produce it. Perhaps the best
method of achieving this is through decentralized, worker-owned enterprises,
co-operatives, and councils. For the same reason that capitalist organizations
support free software, because it represents a common stock of use value they
can apply to production, commons-based producers, and therefore all workers’
self-organized enterprises, can also benefit from such a common stock of
copyleft software and can incorporate software developers in their collective
enterprises.

Free software is therefore valuable for workers’ self-organized production,
giving us a source of valuable capital, software that would have previously
been exclusively controlled by proprietary corporations allowing us
a possibility to retain a greater portion of the product of our labor. Perhaps
just as important as retaining more of the product of our labor is the way the
software community pioneers co-operatively organized large scale distributed
projects, bringing together internationally dispersed contributors working
towards the development of valuable software. In this way, the free software
movement makes important contributions towards the goal of ‘organizing
industrially [and] forming the structure of the new society within the shell of
the old’, the historic ideal of the Industrial Workers of the World.xl

Free Culture Requires a Free Society: Copyfarleft

Despite copyleft’s beneficial role in forming a valuable common stock of
software, it remains problematic when the model is retrofitted back to the
domains of art and culture from which dissent against intellectual property
sprung. Cultural works, unlike software, are a consumer good, not a tool for
use in production, or a producer’s good. Producer's goods, as mentioned
earlier, are the assets used in production, such as the tools and equipment
required to produce consumer goods sold for profit. Capital demand is distinct
from consumer demand. Capital demand is the demand for producer’s goods;
consumer demand is the demand for consumer goods. Capitalism doesn't require
that a profit be made on the production of capital goods because profits are
made through the control of the circulation of consumer goods. Anything that
decreases the cost of capital consequently increases the potential profit that
can be captured through the sale of the goods. Failure to understand the
difference between capital demand and consumer demand propagates the myth that
the success of free software can be a template for free culture. Under
capitalism, only capital can be free. That's why software can be free, but
culture cannot be free without more fundamental shifts in society.

Art is not, in most cases, a common input to production as software is. Thus,
the demand for it is consumer demand, not capital demand. There are certainly
cases in which artworks could be considered productive inputs, such as sound
effects, clip art, music clips, and the like, and the tradition of artists
drawing on the work of their predecessors has been discussed at length above;
however, when we discuss the economics of content-based works, like poems,
novels, films, or music, as well as entertainment-oriented software titles such
as games, we are not talking about producer’s goods, but consumer’s goods.
Capitalist publishing firms and entertainment industry giants will support the
creation of copyleft software in order to employ it in production. However, in
most cases, they will not support the creation of copyleft art. Why would they,
as art is a consumer good, and the industry is not in the business of giving
away consumer goods for free. They are in the business, however, of earning
profits by controlling the distribution of consumer goods.

Like all copyable, reproducible information, content-based works have no direct
exchange value, and, unlike software, they rarely have use value in production
either. Use value exists only among the fans of these works, and, if owners of
property cannot charge these fans money for the right to copy, why would they
fund the production? And if owners of property will not support copyleft art,
which is freely distributed, who will? The answer is unclear. In some cases,
institutions such as private and state cultural funds will, but these can only
support a very small number of artists, and only then by employing dubious and
ultimately somewhat arbitrary selection criteria in deciding who does, and who
does not, receive such funding.

The problem is obvious when attempting to translate copyleft to cultural works.
If someone releases a novel under a copyleft license, and Random House prints
it and makes a profit off the author’s work, Random House has not violated
copyleft as long as the copyleft is passed down. To be ‘free’ means to be open
to commercial appropriation, since freedom, in the terms of copyleft, is
defined as the non-restrictive circulation of information rather than as
freedom from exploitation. It comes as no surprise that the major revision in
applying copyleft to the production of artworks, music, and texts has been to
permit copying, modifying and redistributing as long as it is non-commercial.

Wu Ming, a group of anti-intellectual property authors from Italy, claim it is
necessary to place a restriction on commercial use, or use for profit, in order
to prohibit the parasitic exploitation of cultural workers. They justify this
restriction, and its divergence from the General Public License version of
copyleft, on the grounds that the struggle against exploitation and the fight
for a fair remuneration of labor is the cornerstone of the history of the left.
    Other content providers and book publishers, for example Verso, have
    expanded this restriction by claiming that copying, modifying and
    redistributing should not only be non-profit, but also in the spirit of the
    original, without explaining what this ‘spirit’ means.

Indymedia Romania revised its copyleft definition to make the meaning of ‘in
the spirit of the original’ clearer after repeated problems with the
neo-fascist site Altermedia Romania, whose ‘pranks’ ranged from hijacking the
indymedia.ro domain to copying texts from Indymedia and lying about names and
sources. Indymedia Romania’s restrictions include, not modifying the original
name or source because it goes against the desire for transparency, not
reproducing the material for profit because it abuses the spirit of generosity,
and not reproducing the material in a context that violates the rights of
individuals or groups by discriminating against them on the basis of
nationality, ethnicity, gender or sexuality because that contravenes its
commitment to equality.

Other versions of copyleft have tried to add further restrictions based on
a stronger interpretation of the ‘left’ in copyleft, based not on a negative
freedom from restrictions but on positive principles, like valuing social
co-operation above profit, non-hierarchical participation, and
non-discrimination. The more restrictive definitions of copyleft attempt to
found an information commons that is not just about the free flow of
information, but sees itself as part of a larger social movement that bases its
commonality on shared leftist principles. In its various mutations, copyleft
represents a pragmatic, rational approach that recognizes the limits of freedom
as implying reciprocal rights and responsibilities. These different
restrictions represent divergent interpretations about what these rights and
responsibilities should be. Yet, given the poor economic conditions of the
majority of artists who reserve full copyright, the prospect of non-commercial
mutations of copyleft improving the economic conditions of artists seems
remote.

The chief advantage of reserving commercial rights as an artist is the ability
to license work to the entertainment industry under other terms; as it is
commercial, it doesn’t qualify for free access under the terms of
a non-commercial license. However, artists lack the resources to manufacture
and distribute on a commercial scale. Thus, they are in fact reliant on those
who have the capital to do so, and cannot bargain for anything more than their
subsistence. In essence, selling their ideas is like other workers selling
their labor. This is illustrated in ‘Music Artists’ Earnings and Digitisation:
A Review of Empirical Data from Britain and Germany’ by Martin Kretschmer,
Professor of Information Jurisprudence at Bournemouth University, where he
concludes that ‘the creator has little to gain from exclusivity’.xli Similarly,
in his 2006 study ‘Empirical Evidence On Copyright Earnings’, Kretschmer
states: ‘Earnings from non-copyright, and even non-artistic activities, are an
important source of income for most creators’.xlii This study includes many
startling figures. For example, the median payment distributed by the
Performing Right Society (UK) in 1994 to its copyright holders was £84.xliii

While non-commercial terms may provide a way to integrate artists who produce
free culture into an otherwise proprietary entertainment industry, they do not
challenge that proprietary entertainment industry or address the embedded
exploitation in it. Non-commercial terms are very problematic for those in the
socialist left who advocate for workers’ self-organized production, as these
terms restrict the ability of non-capitalist enterprises to reproduce such
works. Thus, such licenses are detrimental not only to the interests of artists
but to all workers, as they are not compatible with the general objective of
the socialist left: the creation of a worker-controlled economy.

In order for copyleft to mutate into a revolutionary instrument in the domain
of cultural production, it must become ‘copy-far-left’. It must insist on
workers’ ownership of the means of production. The works themselves must be
a part of the common stock, and available for productive use by other
commons-based producers. So long as authors reserve the right to make money
with their works, and prevent other commons-based producers from doing so,
their work cannot be considered to be in the commons at all and remains
a private work. A copyfarleft license must not restrict commercial usage, but
rather usage that is not based in the commons.

Specifically, copyfarleft must have one set of rules for those who are working
within the context of workers’ communal ownership, and another for those who
employ private property and wage labor in production. A copyfarleft license
should make it possible for producers to share freely and to also retain the
value of their labor product. In other words, it must be possible for workers
to earn remuneration by applying their own labor to mutual property, but
impossible for owners of private property to make profit using wage labor.

Thus, under a copyfarleft license, a worker-owned printing co-operative could
be free to reproduce, distribute, and modify the common stock as they like, but
a privately owned publishing company would be prevented from having free
access. In this way, copyfarleft remains free in the same sense as copyleft,
despite restrictions on proprietary redistribution. Copyfarleft only prohibits
subtraction from the commons, not contributions to it.

A copyfarleft license would allow commons-based commercial use while denying
the ability to profit by exploiting wage labor. The copyleft non-commercial
approach does neither, it prevents commons-based commerce, while not
effectively restricting wage exploitation which requires a change in the
distribution of wealth. Copyleft provides a solid foundation for software in
commons-based productions. Copyfarleft could potentially provide a workable
foundation for cultural works to also become part of the common stock employed
by independent producers. Only the promotion of a workers' economy, not simply
the prevention of commercial use, can change the distribution of wealth.

However, for copyfarleft to have an impact, it would need to be employed within
the context of a nascent workers’ economy that includes various forms of
production, such as cultural and material (art as well as food, etc.). In the
absence of such an environment, copyleft and its various mutations have little
advantage for the majority of artists, for whom the prospects of gaining
financially by way of commercial licensing are negligible. For these artists,
anticopyright retains its strong appeal. Anticopyright is a gesture of being
radical that refuses pragmatic compromises and seeks to abolish intellectual
property in its entirety. Anticopyright affirms a freedom that is absolute and
recognizes no limits to its desire.

While some mutations of copyleft have multiplied restrictions, others have
rejected any restriction at all, including the single restriction imposed by
the initial copyleft. It is the movement around peer-to-peer file sharing that
comes closest to the gesture of anticopyright. The best example is the Copyriot
blog by Rasmus Fleischer of Piratbyrån (Bureau of Piracy), an anti-intellectual
property think tank, and the one-time founders of Pirate Bay, the best-known
Bittorent site in the P2P community. The motto of Copyriot is ‘No copyright. No
license’. But there is a difference from the older anticopyright tradition.
Fleischer claims that copyright has become absurd in the age of digital
technology because it has to resort to all sorts of fictions, like distinctions
between uploading and downloading or between producer and consumer, which don’t
actually exist in horizontal peer-to-peer communication.

Piratbyrån rejects copyright in its entirety, not because it was flawed in its
inception, but because it was invented to regulate an expensive, one-way
machine like the printing press, and no longer corresponds to the practices
that have been made possible by current technologies of reproduction. However,
despite the absurdity of the fictions on which copyright rests, the broader
political context suggests that copyleft-inspired models also have an important
role to play. The outright rejection of the legal environment is not always
possible when practical considerations are taken into account. Building
alternative ways of producing and sharing, ‘building the new society within the
shell of the old’, requires us to operate within the capitalist legal system
where the logic of capture and exploitation is embedded. While space for
defiant gestures exist, we must also get on with the business of finding the
forms and structures required to build and expand the commons. It seems clear
that restrictions such as those of copyleft and copyfarleft serve to protect
the commons and keep it free.

So long as copyright continues to exist, copyleft inspired licenses continue to
be needed in order to allow for intellectual freedom within the copyright
regime. Only when workers have achieved their historical role of creating
a society without classes, can we create a truly free culture without
restrictions.

access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to
perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to
the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital
performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including
signs, sounds or images.

i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance
or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
   or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations
   or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
   protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.3. License Grant.
   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants
   You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
   the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as
   stated below:

a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,
and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
original work has been modified.";

c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth
in Section 4(f).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
   subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict
    the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
    License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
    that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
    copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
    from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms
    of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in
    a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
    itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
    a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
    4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation
    any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.

b. Subject to the exception in Section 4(c), you may not exercise any of the
rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of
digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the
exchange of copyrighted works.

c. You may exercise the rights granted in Section 3 for commercial purposes
only if:

i. You are a worker-owned business or worker-owned collective; and

ii. all financial gain, surplus, profits and benefits produced by the

business or collective are distributed among the worker-owners

d. Any use by a business that is privately owned and managed, and that seeks to
generate profit from the labor of employees paid by salary or other wages, is
not permitted under this license.

e. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a),
keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the
name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section
3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for
the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your
rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the
Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

f. For the avoidance of doubt:

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if
Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to
collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member
of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that
is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted
under Section 4(b).

g. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation
to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or
reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification
or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this
Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to
enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
(right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and DisclaimerUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED
   TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
   REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS,
   IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
   OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
   NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
   PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
   JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
   EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
   NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
   LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force
and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),
the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO
Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take
effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite
of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in
the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights
under applicable law.

Venture Communism and Copyfarleft

‘The State is a condition, a certain relationship between human beings, a mode
of human behavior; we destroy it by contracting other relationships, by
behaving differently….’ - Gustav Landauerxliv

Proposing an approach to class struggle based upon venture communism and
copyfarleft would be shocking to many revolutionaries due to the utilization of
joint stock corporations, bonds, rental agreements, copyright licenses and the
retention of the market exchange of the products of labor. Therefore, it must
be noted that venture communism and copyfarleft are only a means of class
struggle, not ideal goals in and of themselves. They are intended as a means of
organizing production towards the goal of building the economic capacity
required to engage in class conflict, and transform a capitalist system. In the
words of the Industrial Workers of the World ‘not only for everyday struggle
with capitalists, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have
been overthrown. By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the
new society within the shell of the old’.xlv

Capitalism, a mode of production where the worker earns only subsistence while
property owners retain the remainder of the productive output, can only create
a society where the interests of the property owner will be reflected in the
social institutions, and the interests of subjugated producers. Both venture
communism and copyfarleft have, as their goal, the creation of a productive
commons that producers can use to accumulate mutual wealth, and thus work
towards realizing their historic role of creating a society free of economic
classes.

As long as producers operate within the capitalist mode of production, they
cannot change society politically. Whatever wealth producers can apply to
influencing social institutions must come from the share of production they
retain, and thus will always be smaller than the share retained by the owners
who can use it to prevent change. When we employ a commons of productive
assets, which have no individual owners but are collectively owned, we retain
the wealth we create, and thus the possibility for a new society is within our
grasp.
